Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

MADELINE!!
I don't even have to have seen you tonight to know you look FIIRREEE!!! Holy shit youre such an amazing addition to our weird ass family. You bring the best energy in the world; every time I see you you are a hype woman; you know the best questions to ask and you make everyone you're talking to feel like a million bucks. 
I hope you have the best time this weekend and thank you so much for traveling all this way!!
Love you!
