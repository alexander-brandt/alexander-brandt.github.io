Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Katie,
The honorary Peachstone Drive Flynn sister!!! I love you so much and am so grateful to have you as one of my cousin-friends. I always want to sit next to you at family gatherings because you're just as funny as your brothers, you're just not as loud. 
Thanks for always sending sweet check-in texts when things aren't going fabulously, or the happy birthday/congrats messages. They may be small, but you're so consistently thoughtful that it never fails to make my day a little better.

I hope you have a wonderful time tonight! Thanks for loving Alex and me!!
