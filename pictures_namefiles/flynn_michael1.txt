Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Michael,
You truly are the most beloved cousin. It is proven with the COTY trophy: only one name appears twice.
Teaching you was so fun - it was when I got to see first hand how wicked smart you were, and your work ethic was even more impressive. I love seeing how that has carried through, and I'm so impressed with your MBA that you're about to complete.
Keep up the amazing work all around - we all know you were Grandmother's favorite grandson, so keep making her proud.
