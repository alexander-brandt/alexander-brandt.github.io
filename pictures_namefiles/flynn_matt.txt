Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Matt,
I'm super sad I missed teaching you by one year. You and Danny are what I called the "gap years" for me -- you're too young to have gone to high school with me, but you're too old for me to have taught you.
Nevertheless, it's been super fun to get to know you as an adult. I'm so impressed with all the cool shit you come up with - whether it's the Beerhams or the survivor game (its on my calendar for MDW!) - you always take life by storm.
Thanks for being super welcoming to Alex as he joins the fam. I love hanging with you and Suzie and we're so happy you're with us tonight!
