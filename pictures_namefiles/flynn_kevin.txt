KEVIN!!!!!

A New Years Eve wedding at Gonzaga!?!?! Could it get any better than this?? I think not!!!!

Thanks so much for being here to celebrate with Alex and me, bud!! You ALAYS make me smile. Seeing you at Gonzaga made my day a million times better, and I love getting your texts when I'm in New York. You do a great job of keeping our family on our toes and getting us pumped up for every event.

I hope you have an amazing time tonight, man. I can't wait to see you and Matt do Soul Man together. 

I love you, Kev!!!
