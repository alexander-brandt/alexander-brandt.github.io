Dear Frank,

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your friendship and for being such an important part of my life.  As we prepared for today, I can't help but think about all the memories we've shared together the past year and a half and how grateful I am to have you as my brother-in-law.  When shooting arrows in your backyard by the fire, or sharing beers and cigars in the VA mountains, you have often lent me a calm and sagacious perspective, and offered your support and guidance whenever I needed it.

Your kind words and advice have meant the world to me, and I am so grateful to have you as a trusted confidant.  I hope you enjoy the rest of the evening and again, thank you for all your help and excitement before and during our big day!

Sincerely,

Alex
