Hello Kim and Joey!

Thank you so much for coming to our wedding.  I know it has been a little while since we last saw one another but I always have such fond memories of our fun family times at Bethany Beach and when Papa and Uncle Bill would get together and make us all laugh.  I am so excited to introduce you to Casey and the rest of the Flynn family -- and looking forward to catching up more in 2023!

Sincerely,

Alex Brandt
