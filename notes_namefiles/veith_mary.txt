Mary and Lisa,

Ahhh!! When I describe who Mary is to people, I just am like... I basically followed her through life; From SJB to Visitation to ACE to back to DC to teaching to actually coaching together... thanks for leading the way!! Our carpool rides were some of the funniest memories in HS, whether it was you asking me to do dip with you, playing some classical music game (guess that movie), strategizing about some game we had coming up, or just in straight silence after a long day at school or losing a game... it was always nicer to do it with you! 

Thank you SO MUCH for being here tonight to celebrate!!! It was so amazingly special to be there with you on your big day. The boat was absolutely epic; if tonight can be half as fun, I'll call it a success!!!

Whether I see you every day coaching or just once a year to catch up - it's always as if no time has passed. Thanks so much for such a wonderful lifelong friendship. 

I hope you have an amazing time tonight!!
