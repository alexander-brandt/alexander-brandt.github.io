DG!!!

The grand "Flynn-ale"! Our last wedding is here!!

Since Lindsay's wedding so many ions ago (epic) to all our other amazing celebrations of all shapes and sizes all over the country (&Italy!), it has been heartwarming to watch each of you get married. It has been equally fun to watch you all become moms (so excited for March!!). 

Whether I have seen you a lot due to proximity (Chicago, DC, NYC) or only a few times a year at our gatherings, I know I can text each of you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you all since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are each here 20 years later to celebrate!!

Jackie --
You literally got me through Covid!! Thank you for such amazing visits during such a depressing time!!
You are just a bundle of joy -- I have adored watching you, Jon, and Lottie build the most wonderful life together. You deserve all of it and more!!

I hope you have an amazing time tonight - cheers to 2023!!!
