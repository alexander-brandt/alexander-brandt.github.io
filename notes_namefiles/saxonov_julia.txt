To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

JULIA!!!!
Holy cow I can't believe we're here!! And you're here with your hot husband!! And your tiny adorable baby is hope with his family!! We've come such a long way!!!

I adore you so much. You literally make me feel 1000% better about myself whenever I see you. You are the definition of a pump-up woman. And you do that for everyone! Which is why you are so loved.

Thank you for being my pump up woman, especially for the last decade. I can't wait to have our families grow and visit one another in California, NY/NJ, the DMV, and beyond.

I love you!!
