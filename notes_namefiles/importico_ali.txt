To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

Ali,

You have been one of my biggest supporters, cheerleaders, listeners, confidants, partner in crime, and ride or die since 2006 in an LCA bathroom. Thank you for your constant friendship - you are integral to so many of my favorite memories, and during times of sadness I can always lean on you.

You are truly one of the best friends around --  thank you and I love you!!!!
