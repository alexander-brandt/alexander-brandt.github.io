Aunt Mary and Uncle Mike,

Thank you SO MUCH for being here to celebrate with Alex and me!! I know your reaction is of course "we would never miss it!!" But that is simply a testament to how amazing you both are. For anyone else, it is not a given that you would come down to Maryland as much as you do. 

But you guys are rockstars, and your love of family has you consistently showing up. I'm sure it sometimes feels like we take it for granted, but please know that everyone (including myself) sees it and recognizes it, and we LOVE having you around!

My week at the beach with you all is always one of my favorite times, because thats when I feel like I get some real catch up time. Thank you for asking me to be Daniel's godmother - it is truly an honor and I was so happy he was able to be in my ceremony tonight.

I hope you have a WONDERFUL time tonight and cheers to an amazing start to 2023!!!!
