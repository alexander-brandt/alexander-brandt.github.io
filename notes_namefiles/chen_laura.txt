Laura,

Thank you so much for traveling all this way to be here with us tonight!! Our visit to you in February was one of the most fun weekends -- we'll need to do it again ASAP!!!

From the beginning of Alex, I always heard about his best friend Jeff. Naturally, you came into play very early on and Alex always spoke so highly of you. However, I was not expecting to "click" with you as easily as I did! Thank you for being SO welcoming during our visit. I hope we have many travels in our future!!

I hope you had a great time this weekend and that you will have an amazing countdown to midnight. See you on the dance floor!!
