Liddi girls,

Who in the right mind let me babysit you at age 12 for like 8 hours a day? No wonder we're all so weird!! Just kidding (kinda). 

Mary,

Thank you SO much for being here tonight to celebrate Alex and me!!! In my own personal humble opinion, I think we're the two most fun cousins (although Matt and Drew may give us a run for our money). Do NOT show that to anyone (especially Bridget, she'll be mad at me all night, and I'm the bride!!).

Anyways... please try and keep both Frank and the Murrays in check tonight. You can outdrink most of them, so please go easy on the shots. But if you don't, its okay, it's New Years eve, after all!!!!

Never change one iota, I love you tons.
