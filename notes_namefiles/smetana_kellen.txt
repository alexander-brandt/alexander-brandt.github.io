To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!


Kellen, 

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight!!! It means so much that you are here; I know a cross country flight leaving Marie at home with your parents during the holidays is NO easy feat -- but I am so so appreciative!!

You have made Julia the happiest girl in the world. I have adored watching your relationship evolve from HBS to SF to Oakland; you all are truly wonderful and I am so lucky to have you both in my life.

Have a WONDERFUL night tonight - dad's night out!! - and cheers to more amazing adventures to come.

Casey
