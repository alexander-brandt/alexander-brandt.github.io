Connor,

I haven't known many men as long as you, and of that short list you probably know me best.  There has never been a family trip where you haven't brought a light to any room that could hold you with your enthuiasm, optimism, and joy.  And on those trips, when the clock strikes midnight, there was a seriouness and solemnity that took hold of our conversations.  I am forever thankful that we could have a cigar and whiskey, talk about our thoughts and concerns, and stare at the night sky and wonder how we could be are best selves.

I adore you, brother.  There is a greatness that is palpable in all that you do, say, and are.  

I am so thankful that you and your family could join Casey and me.  I love you to the moon and back.

Sincerely,

Alexander
