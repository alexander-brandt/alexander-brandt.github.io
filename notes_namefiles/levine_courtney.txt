Courtney and Trevor,

Thank you SO MUCH for being here with Alex and me tonight!!! Court, I'm sure watching tonight sober will be quite the amusing night for you - please take notes and do tell me all the funny people watching next week!!

Court, your friendship over the years, especially during Covid, has kept me sane. Thank you so much for being so understanding, loving, loyal, and downright amazing.

I have loved watching both of you and your solid partnership. From Bobby to twins - you all have a beautiful balance and I admire how you take on all new challenges with faith and with love.

I hope you both have an amazing time tonight - thank you so much for being here with us!!!
