Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Lukas,

Thank you so much for being here tonight!! Yours and Jillians was literally the MOST fun -- I hope tonight can be half as fun as that night! I absolutely love the way you and Jilly tackle life; your enthusiasm, care for one another, and absolute fearlessness in your careers is inspiring. 

I can't wait to see you on the dance floor - especially during Rosalita!!
