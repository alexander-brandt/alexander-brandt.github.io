Jillian!!!!!

I wish I had just had you come and plan my wedding because honestly all I wanted was yours and Sally's wedding but in DC. I don't think I came close but cheers to having an amazing inspiration!!

It has been so fun to get to know you this past decade. You make Sally SO HAPPY and it has been so heartwarming to watch the two of you raise your adorable family. You are truly the best mama around, and I am so impressed by all that you're able to do.

Thanks for making me laugh til my sides hurt every time I see you. I know its been a few years, but hopefully post-covid our visits will be more frequent. 

Thanks for traveling all this way to celebrate... and HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!!!!
