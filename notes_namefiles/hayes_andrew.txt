Dear Andrew,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! Your serene and friendly personality has been such a positive force as I have gotten to know Casey's friends from Gonzaga and Visitation.  I also really appreciate the extra effort you have made to make me feel welcome as a newcomer in social gatherings. Our shared interest in golf has given us a great opportunity to get to know each other better, and we look forward to spending more time together in the future.

Congratulations on your beautiful new house with Kelly, and on the arrival of your precious new baby, Owen. We had so much fun at his baptism, and we are excited to see what the future holds for you and your family.

Hope you are having a great time and are ready to dance the night away!

With gratitude,

Alexander
