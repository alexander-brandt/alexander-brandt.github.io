To my favorite McCarthys--

Omgosh I can't believe all 7 of the McCarthys are here to celebrate!!! It has been such fun to watch you all grow up -- from Michael's freshmen year to his 5th year at Fairfield... it's been a wild ride!! It is an honor to have you all with me tonight.

Sunday nights at your home were always hilarious -- sometimes routine... planning classes, keeping up with homework, finishing projects -- sometimes absolutely batshit crazy... someone had an exam they hadn't started studying for, a project that was late, the usual.... It was endlessly entertaining and sometimes weirdly stressful. 

Molly,
You are such a beautiful soul inside and out!!! You have all of the best qualities of your mom and dad combined. Determination, kindness, loyalty, smarts... I could go on and on. Thank you for being with Alex and me to celebrate tonight - it means so much to me!!
