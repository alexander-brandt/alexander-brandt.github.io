Tom!!!

Welcome to the clan... we are insane but we're fun!!!

In all seriousness, we are so so happy to have you marrying our Patsy girl this coming year. She is clearly so happy and so at home with you -- we couldn't be more thrilled to see you two officially tie the knot.

I hope you are able to kick back, relax, and enjoy tonight. Thank you so much for traveling from Chicago to celebrate us. We can't wait to do so for you in 7 short months!!!
