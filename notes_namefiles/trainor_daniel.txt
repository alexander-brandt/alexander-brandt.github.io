GODSON!!!!!!

Is this your first "adult" wedding??? Kind of!! We'll sneak Madeline and Danny's in there as well... you made it to the bar at least!!

It was the greatest honor to be your godmother, even though at times I feel like I've failed miserably. Sorry! I was young. 

Anyways, I have loved seeing you get older and it's so fun to talk to you now that you're in high school and about to head off to college. You really seem to just "get it." You're fun, athletic, social, and can hang with all the older cousins no problem. Pretty impressive given that some of us are old AF!

Thanks so much for being part of the ceremony today. I can't wait to see where you'll head next year and beyond. Never hesitate to text about absolutely anything!!!
