WESSEL GIRLS!!!!!!

I love my sisters but beyond that, you guys are the absolute epitome of #sistergoals!!!!

I adore being around each and everyone one of you. From your dances at such a young age to the musicals to holidays to HH's... I am so lucky to have such fun cousins like you!!!

RAE!!!!!
Omgod I wish you were at my table tonight!! You make me laugh the hardest!!I am so so so happy that you are in NYC now... 2022 was crazy but I'll be much more purposeful to have some HH with you and Jilly in 2023!! Thanks for being the best ball of energy I've ever seen. You never fail to bring such positive vibes and you make everyone around you feel so special. You are the BEST!

Have so much fun tonight and I'll see you on the dance floor!!!
