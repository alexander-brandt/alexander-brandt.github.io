Courtneyyyy!!!!

I hit the absolute JACKPOT with you as my sister-in-law!! Thanks so much for bringing such joy to my dearest Alex, and keeping me endlessly laughing!!

Although you *slightly* concerned me with the cold-shoulder that day on the beach, I had mad respect for someone who makes me work for the hand of your brother :) Game respect game. 

It has been so much fun to hear about all of your UChicago adventures, studies, and accomplishments. Alex and I are so proud of you and I love seeing you take life by storm. In some ways, you remind me so much of myself, which makes me happy, smile, and frightens me a bit as well!!!

Thank you for being my bridesmaid this weekend and for being one of Alex' "best man." 

See you on the dance floor!!!!

Love you forever
