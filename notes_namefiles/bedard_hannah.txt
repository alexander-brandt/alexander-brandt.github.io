To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

Hannah, 
Thank you for forever keeping me laughing!! You always have the best stories and the best dry, witty outlook on life. Thanks for staying in town during the cold --  I look forward to when I move back to DC and can see you even more!!!

Cheers to an amazing 2023!!
