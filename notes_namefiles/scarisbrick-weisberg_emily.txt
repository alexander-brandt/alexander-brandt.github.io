Dear Emily,

I don't even know where to begin.  Between our joint moves (expertly and intentionally cordinated, I might add), and our 12+ years of friendship, there are very few people at this party who have a more complete picture of me.

I have always been so impressed with your focus, diligence, and industriousness in both your personal life and professional pursuits -- it made me SO happy when you started dating one of my best friends!  As your and Jon's relationship blossomed into marriage (and now parenthood!), I have felt uniquely  thankful and privledged to have had so many adventures and created so many memories together.  I love you and am forever blessed to know you.

Best,

Alex Brandt
