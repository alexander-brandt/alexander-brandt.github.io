Emily!!!

I choose this picture out of the many of the four of us because this was such special day for me... and lord knows it would not have gone as smoothly without you there!!

You have been such a huge part of Alex's life. He talks about you in the highest esteem, and he trusts you and Jon 100%. I am always amazed at how much he opens up to you about so many things - he really trusts you more than almost anyone, and it is such a special friendship to observe.

I have loved getting to know you over the last year - you are so fun and accomplished, and I have adored watching you grow into your new role as "mom" to Eliza.

I look forward to many Hoboken adventures in our future. Thank you SO much for being here this entire weekend to celebrate with us.

Love you!!
