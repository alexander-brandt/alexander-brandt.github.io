Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Danny-
I know you and Madeline are bringing your A+ game tonight, because you always do!!! I have literally the best time with you. I miss you being further away, but I appreciate you always being so great about coming back to the DMV area. 

Cheers to an amazing night - if it can be half as fun as your wedding, I"ll be pleased!!!!
