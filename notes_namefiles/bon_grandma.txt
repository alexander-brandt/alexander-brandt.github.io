Grandma Bon,

Thank you so much for being here to celebrate with Alex and me tonight. I know that traveling over the winter holidays is not easy, and I am so grateful that you made the trip -- it wouldn't be the same without you!!

Thank you for all the wonderful, loving memories that you have given me over the years. Whether it was teaching us to paint at the beach or celebrating the many weddings that we've had over the past decade, I cherish every one of them. 

I love you so much!!
