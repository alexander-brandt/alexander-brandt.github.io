Robbie,

When I was looking for a picture of you and me, I found a few group photos. However, my favorite was of this montage (above). You were *supposed* to take the picture on the right. However, before that, you made sure to take about 10 selfies of yourself before getting to us. I appreciate that -- always be the star of your own show :) :) :) 

Anyways.... 

You Aphi husbands are all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love Wendy so much, and Wendy loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. I know it was a cross country flight AND leaving Aidan at home, so I am so so appreciative.

Have an AMAZING time and cheers to more adventures in 2023 and beyond!
