Karen O'Brien - INCOMPLETE.

Dear KAREN,

Thank you so much for not only celebrating this weekend with us, but for being an indispensible and incomparable contributor to the success of our big day!  The escort cards, programs, and signage are spectacular and I am so awed by the inredible amount of work you put into them.  From our first dates, Casey talked about how special you were and how important you were to her Mom and Dad.  When I started coming down to Manor Park and Maryland, you were so friendly and welcoming to me.

Love,

Alex
