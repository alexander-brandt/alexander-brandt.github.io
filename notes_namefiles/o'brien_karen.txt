Dear *KAREN*,

We are so thrilled to have you join us on our wedding day!  I will never be able to fully thank you for your hard work and dedication to preparing the programs, place settings, signs, and so many other critical facets of the ceremony and celebration.  Your kind and devoted nature were apparent from our first meetings, as was your warmth and tenacity.  You welcomed me into the greater Maryland community.  And I am so grateful to have with us on our special day.

We can't wait to celebrate with you and share this joyous occasion with you. Thank you for all that you do, Karen. You are truly a blessing in our lives.

With love and gratitude,

Alex
