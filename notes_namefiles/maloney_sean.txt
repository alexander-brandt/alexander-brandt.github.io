SEANNNNN!
You're here!! On New Years Eve!!! Thank you!!!  I know you were just here for Christmas and I know this is a tough night to leave in the entertainment industry, I so appreciate it!!!

Turkeybowls when you were little were always fun, and I knew you were a funny kid, but it really all started in 2013-2014. I'm SO HAPPY you switched into my class and that I got to know you so well that year. It kicked off a decade of cousin-friendship and I love following ALL of your adventures.

You remind me so much of myself in so many ways -- I love your never-miss-a-moment attitude and constant thoughtfulness of others. MarchMadness buddies for life? Maybe you'll help me pick the teams one of these days.

Have so much fun and keep your side of the table in check.
