HELEN!!!!!

Can you believe it?? We're here!! Nearly 10 years after I met you, we are celebrating such a huge milestone. You have given me a lot of advice over the years.... Two of those pieces were this: Marry a man over the age of 30, and marry a man who makes you laugh.

Thankfully, both of those two things are true!! While you've only met Alex briefly, you will love future conversations with him and I look forward to sharing more adventures and memories with you.

Thank you so much for all your love this past decade. You have been such a cheerleader, mentor (hah!), confidant, and friend. I'm so honored to have you and Doug with me tonight.

I love you so much and can't wait to cheers, laugh, and dance with you tonight!!
