Danny!!!

It is SO special to have 5/6's of the OG App clan here. After 30+ years and adventuress, it is so meaningful to me to have you and Matthew with us tonight to celebrate!

Our moms' friendship especially is very cool, and from it, I feel connected to all the Apps. Whether or not I see you on the regular or not - I am always getting updates and love following your life through their connection. 

Whether it's been a year or five, I love catching up with you and this weekend is no different. I know you could be a million other places for your New Years Eve, so THANK YOU for making another Flynn/App memory with us tonight. I can't wait to catch up and see you on the dance floor!!!!!
