Trish!!!

Officially my sister!!!!

I am so excited for years and years of making more fun memories together. There are parts of Alex that no one understands quite like you.  I am so grateful to (obviously) be marrying Alex, but to also be marrying into such an amazing, fun-loving family!

I am so thankful to have such an inspiring, interesting, and talented sister in law. I cannot wait to see what your future will hold, and hope that it is always within a few hours of us!!!

I love you SO MUCH and cannot wait to dance the night away with you!!
