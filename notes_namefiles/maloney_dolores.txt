Uncle John and Aunt Dolores,

Not going to lie, you were definitely the hardest relationship to explain to Alex. Just when he thought he had the whole Flynn/Wessel tree down, I was like.... Well there's also this thing about the Maloneys.... And he was like "one family at a time!!!".

But alas, you are family! And I'm so happy you are here. I have loved seeing you over the years at all the Maloney events, and I have adored getting to know your children, especially over the past decade through Gonzaga. You have done an absolutely amazing job raising them - they each have your smarts, savvy, ability to make all feel welcome, humor, and voice volume. 

Thank you SO MUCH for being with Alex and me tonight to celebrate. I hope you have an amazing weekend and I'm so honored to share it with you.
