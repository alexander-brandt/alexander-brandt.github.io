Kendra and Dave,

Thank you SO much for being here to celebrate Alex and me!!! You have been part of our family forever, and it wouldn't have been the same without you. Thank you for always doing such an amazing job of showing up and supporting in the happiest times and in the harder times. 

Watching you guys and your love and support for one another has been inspiring. You do an amazing job at putting one an other first while still raising two rockstar kids and creating a great community around you. Alex was so touched, Dave, that you invited him to the golf outing over Labor Day. It's thoughtful things like that gesture that make you guys the best friends around!!

We look forward to the days when we are back in the DMV and see you both more. Until then, thank you for always brining great energy to celebrations like this. We love you!!
