Caroline!!!!

I'm so happy you were able to make it up to celebrate with me!!! I know it was an expensive trip and you don't know a ton of other people here, but it means the world to me to have you here.

DAMN did we have fun!! I'm slightly concerned for us, but good golly was 2010-2012 absolutely absurd. From our costumes to our bike rides to our Tybee adventures... you were the most incredible source of friendship, laughter, and fun. 

I'm so proud of all you have accomplished in your career. I have seen from day one how hard you work and how much you care about Catholic education. Wherever your vocation brings you, I know you will do GREAT things.

Thanks for you love, prayers, support, and AWESOMENESS that you share with me and this world.

I love yoU!
