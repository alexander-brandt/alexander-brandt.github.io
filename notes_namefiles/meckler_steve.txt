Dear Steve,

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all of your support and friendship during my wedding and over the past years.  It was also so special since we just had so much fun with you and Lauren at your own wedding back in September!  Your wedding was such a special and memorable experience, and I am so grateful to have been able to witness two wonderful people joining together to begin the adventure of a lifetime.

Our years together in graduate school were some of the most challenging and rewarding of my life, and I will always be grateful for the hard work and camaraderie that we shared. We may have studied hard, but I will always remember the fun we had watching cartoons and exploring the great outdoors. Your love of nature and adventure is truly inspiring, and I have no doubt that you'll conquer any mountain (or bike trail) that comes your way.

Thank you again for everything, Steve. I was so blessed to have had you as my roommate.  I continue to be blessed by having you friend, and I hope that our relationship continues to thrive in the years to come.

With love and appreciation,

Alex
