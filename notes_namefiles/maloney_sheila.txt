Dear Aunt Sheila and Uncle Tim,

Thank you so much for being here tonight to celebrate with Alex and me!!! You ALWAYS know how to bring the party, so I hope tonight is no exception!!

Thank you for your love, support, and kindness over the years. You are always first to offer to host an event or shower for any type of celebration - you have Grandmother Flynn's zeal for life and love of family. She lives on in you both!

I have especially loved getting to know your children as young adults over the past decade. They're all crazy, but in the best way possible. You should be so proud!

Thank you for welcoming Alex with open arms. I hope you have the best time tonight - cheers to an amazing 2023 and beyond!!
