Dear Kathleen and Brian,

I am so excited to have you both join us at our wedding! Your presence means so much to me and we can't wait to celebrate this special day with you.

Kathleen, I am so proud of you for finishing such an impressive career at UVA and for your amazing return offer from Capital One starting next year. Your dedication to your studies and your future career is truly inspiring. And of course, I will try to downplay our collective scholastic achievements in front of the other cousins.  We can't all be Summer Olympics Gold Medalists.

Brian, I am forever thankful to you as the dealer at our family beach trips.  Our shared love of poker and cards has brought us many fun and memorable moments, and I look forward to creating even more special memories together on our big day.

I can't wait to celebrate with both of you and I am so grateful to have you as a part of our special day.

With love,

Alex
