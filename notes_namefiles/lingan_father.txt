Father Lingan - INCOMPLETE.

Dear Father Lingan,

I was so nervous walking into your office just a few months ago.  I was so thankful that Priscilla and Kevin told me many times what a warm and magnanimous host you would be.  Their praise was understated.

Your questions about faith and partnership were inspiring and put Casey and me so at ease.  I am so thankful that you celebrated our mass today and that you could join us at our reception.  Gonzaga has been such a special place for Casey and many other Flynns and your presence brought a steadfast joy that our guests from far and near could feel.  I am excited for your students -- the young Eagles you shepard are very lucky.

Warmly and sincerely,

Alexander
