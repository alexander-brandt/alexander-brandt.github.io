Dear Father Lingan,

I was so nervous walking into your office just a few months ago.  I was so thankful that Priscilla and Kevin told me many times what a warm and magnanimous host you would be.  Their praise was understated.

Thank you so much for saying our wedding mass and joining us at the reception.  Your generosity with your time and thoughtfulness in helping us prepare for marriage have meant so much to us.   Your questions about faith and partnership were inspiring and put Casey and me so at ease from our very first meeting.  As a Gonzaga graduate and friend of the Flynn family, it feels so special to have you with us on one of the most important days of our lives. We hope you enjoy the food and drink and know how much we appreciate your open embrace of both us as a couple and our family and friends.  Your presence means so much to us and we are so grateful to have you with us on this special day.

Gonzaga has been such a special place for Casey and many other Flynns and your presence brought a steadfast joy that our guests from far and near could feel.  I am excited for your students -- the young Eagles you shepard are very lucky.

Warmly and sincerely,

Alexander
