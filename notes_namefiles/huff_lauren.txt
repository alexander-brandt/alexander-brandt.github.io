LAUREN!

I wish I could include a picture of you and Courtney breaking international speed limits on a jet ski but INTERPOL was strict...

All jokes aisde, I am so thankful that you could join Casey and I today.  You and your family are a bedrock of my memories and joys.  When we would vacation together, you always had the most insightful questions, fun ideas/quips, and inspirations for meaning.  As you grow into such an amazing person I am inspired by the work you do for others and the ways which you make the world a better place.  Thank you for always being YOU.

Sincerely,

Alexander
