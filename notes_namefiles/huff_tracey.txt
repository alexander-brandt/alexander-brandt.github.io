Dear Mrs. Huff,

It's hard to put into words the thankfulness I feel for you, Mr. Huff, and your children.  We have so many incredible memories from our trips abroad or our reunions in NYC.  I cannot hear the word "party" without thinking of our "party pics."

Your steadfast love for your family and your friendship for my family has been such a lovely chorus in my life.  I hope to always embody the spirit of optimism and positivity you bring to every encounter, first handshake, and last dance.  Thank you for all you have taught me, and everything you inspire in us all.

All my love,

Alexander
