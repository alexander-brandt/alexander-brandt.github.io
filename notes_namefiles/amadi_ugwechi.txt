Ugwechi, 

I love you!! It means the world to me that you are here celebrating with me. If anyone has seen the ups and downs of my life, especially the past 5 years, it has been you. Thank you for being my cheerleader and confidant. 

Gwaych, you're one of the most impressive people I know. You have continued to strive for goal after goal and met each with greater success than the last. Your work ethic and love of family is so inspiring. I look forward to Christmas 2042 when we send each other our family's matching pajamas pictures. I know that you will have so many traditions by then, and I can't wait to hear about every single one.

Two years ago with you in Mexico, I manifested Alex into my life on New Years Eve. Whatever you're manifesting tonight, I hope you get it. Regardless of what that is, know that you're scrappy-ass friend that you can't get rid of will be there cheering you on.

I love you!
