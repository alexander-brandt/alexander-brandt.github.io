Kim and Mike-

It is SUCH an honor to have 7/7 McCarthys here to celebrate with me tonight!!!

From my bball days to the 6 years of (almost) every Sunday night at your house, you guys have been the best cheerleaders around. I have so enjoyed cheering your children on, and I have felt the love and support right back.

I have taken copious notes about parenting and friendship from you both over the years. No marriage or partnership is perfect, and it is hard work; nevertheless, watching how you both divide and conquer, support and love, talk and listen... it has been truly inspiring. And you have five WONDERFUL kids to show for it!

Thank you for constantly showering so much love and attention my way. Alex and I are absolutely thrilled to have you here and I hope you have the BEST night!!!
