Mrs. Gannon,

Thank you so much for being here to celebrate with me tonight. It means so much to Alex and me to have you with us. Your friendship with my mom and all the Flynns has been so special for the last 20 years. 

Thank you for the amazing Camp Maria memories, the love, support, and prayers that you have showered on all of us.

I hope you have a wonderful night and cheers to an amazing 2023!!
