Dutch and Lisa,

Thank you SO MUCH for celebrating with Alex and me tonight!!! Dutch, you were always my mom's favorite cousin (don't tell George). You always do such an amazing job at showing up - whether it is the happy or the sad, you have an amazing support of family.

Thank you for bringing laughter and joy wherever you go. I always enjoy catching up at a basketball game or a family event, and I hope it happens more!!

Thank you for your love and support. Have SO much fun tonight!!
