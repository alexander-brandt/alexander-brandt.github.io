Dear Mike,

I feel especially thankful that you stood next to me today during the ceremony as you were the first member of the team Flynn family that I met!  When I left our first lunch in North Carolina I was excited by how many interests we had in common -- from personal finance to bourbon tasting.  You and Colleen have been so supportive of Casey's and my relationship and I am always humbled by the sincerity and warmth with which you host us.

I also feel lucky to have you in my life because you are such an exemplary husband and father (Charlie, Reese, Peter, and Tommy are as adorable as they are fun to be around!).  I have lots to learn about both topics - but I am happy to have a great role model.

Best,

Alexander
