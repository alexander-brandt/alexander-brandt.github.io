Jenni and Todd-

I am so beyond thrilled that you traveled in from Chicago to be with Alex and me tonight!!! What an amazing day to have both of you here to celebrate with us.

You both have meant so much to my family over the past many years. Jenni,  I have looked up to you since 2002 - you and Janice have paved the way in so many ways, from Visitation to Notre Dame and beyond. Thank you for being another amazing woman to look up to!!

Todd, my visits to Notre Dame were always hilarious, and having you there with the Cavanaugh and Lyons girls was always a treat. Thanks for always being so welcoming and including :)

I hope you all have a wonderful time tonight -- you parents deserve a wild night out!! Cheers to past, current, and future celebrations together.
