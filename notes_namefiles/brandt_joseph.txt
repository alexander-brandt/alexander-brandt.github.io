Mr. and Mrs. Brandt,

I knew I hit the jackpot immediately when I met Alex. It was very clear almost from the beginning that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.

What I didn't know (until 2 months later) was that I also hit the jackpot with my in-laws!!! I could not have asked for a more fun-loving, supportive, and close-knit family to marry into. I adore all three of your children and the close bond that you have with one another.

Thank you for giving Alex such an incredible model of what a marriage should look like. You two have built such an amazing life together over the past 36+ years... something to aspire to!!!

Thank you endlessly for your generosity over this past weekend. It means so much to see all our family and friends together today to celebrate Alex and me.

I love you!!
