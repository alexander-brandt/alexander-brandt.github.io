To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!


Joe, 

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. It means so much that you are here!! If this wedding can be half as fun as New Orleans, I'll call it a GREAT SUCCESS!!!

First, thank you for always letting me third wheel with you and Ali for so so many years. You never batted an eyelash, although I'm sure it got old after awhile with it being "Joe and the girls." But we always want you around!!!

Second, thank you for being so incredibly welcoming to Alex. Even though he's a newbie, you are always so kind in welcoming him into the fold and putting him at ease.

I hope you have the BEST time tonight! Cheers to 2023!!!
