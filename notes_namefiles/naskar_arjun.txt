To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!


Arjun-

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. It means so much that you are here!!! Your Miami wedding was absolutely magical, so we have big shoes and expectations to live up to. I can ALWAYS count on you to bring amazing energy, though, so I'll look to you, Ashish, and Varun to tear up the dance floor!!

I have especially loved having you and Ar back on the east coast. I am so excited to watch you two become parents -- you will be the absolute BEST! 

Have so much fun tonight - parents night out!!! - and cheers to 2023.
