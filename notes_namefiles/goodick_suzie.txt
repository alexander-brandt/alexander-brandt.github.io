Suzie!!!!

I love this picture of us because all three of us were so hungover from a wedding/flights the night before. I thought I was going to die, so hanging back with you and Matt who were also in less-than-optimal shape was such an amazing way to do family mini golf.

I LOVE spending time with you and I'm so grateful you've been around to celebrate at my shower, and the welcome party, and again tonight! You've been so impressive handling everything with school with such ease. Every time I see you, you are handling everything with ease, taking everything in stride, and just down to hang.

I hope you have an amazing night tonight - thanks for bringing such awesome energy!!

See you on the dance floor!
