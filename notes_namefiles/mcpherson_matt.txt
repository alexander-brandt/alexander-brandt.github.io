Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Matt,

It has been so fun to get to know you this past decade. I cannot believe you have three kids!! Watching you and Diana grow your family has brought me so much joy.

Thanks for being such an amazing addition to the Wessel/Flynn/Liddi/Ballard clan at large.

Have a wonderful night and thanks for being here to celebrate with us!!
