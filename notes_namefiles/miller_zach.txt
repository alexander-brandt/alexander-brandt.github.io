Dear Zach,

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for joining us today, and for all of your support and friendship during my time out in California. It was such a fun and memorable time, and I am so grateful to have shared it with you.  Spending time with you at your home in San Francisco was such a treat, and from our first meetings I always admired your calm and friendly demeanor.

I also felt priviledged to watch your and Jen's relationship grow, and to learn from your partnership and teamwork.  You are an amazing husband and father, and it's clear how much you care about your family. Your entrepreneurial spirit is also so impressive, and I always enjoy hearing about your business ventures and ideas.

Thank you again for everything, Zack. I am so grateful to have you as my cousin and friend, and I hope that our relationship continues to grow and flourish in the years to come.

Best,

Alex
