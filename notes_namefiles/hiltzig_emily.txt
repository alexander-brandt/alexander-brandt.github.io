EMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Can you believe all these pictures are relatively recently?? I went back into the archives and I was just such a mess in London, I couldn't even stomach them. HAH! But boy did we have fun.

I met you at one of the best times of my life, but even with all the fun we had, I didn't expect to get such a lifelong friend in you. Our reunion from our NYC proximity (although we needed to meet in Boca, of course) was serendipitous. Thank you for all your love and friendship over the past few years - especially when I needed to lean on you in Covid!!

Thanks for being the most supportive friend around. You have always been my biggest cheerleader - I appreciate that SO MUCH.

I promise to always cheerlead YOU on!! Your job, your Wisconsin festival, your aunt-life, your dating life... all of it. I'll be there with bells and whistles on when it's your turn. I love you!!

See you on the dance floor!!
