Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and I tonight.

Mrs. App,

Thank you especially for ALL of your love, support, and prayers over the years. Your friendship to my mom and to my entire family means the world to me. It is so special to have so many of the Apps with me tonight. The shower you threw me to kick off the celebrations was SO special - thank you again for all the time you put in to make me feel like the most special girl in the world.

I hope you have the BEST time tonight and I can't wait to see you on the dance floor!
