Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Lindsey,

Thank you so much for being with us to celebrate tonight!! I love chatting with you, especially during the beach weekends. Now that we live next to Mary Kate, I'll have to lure you and Johnny to Hoboken for a visit.

Have a wonderful time tonight and I'll see you on the dance floor!!
