Mr. and Mrs. Veith,

Thank you SO MUCH for being here tonight to celebrate!!! It is so special to have such long-term friends with me (even before I was born!)

From SJB to Visitation to ACE to back to coaching at Visitation, you have always been the best cheerleaders - both on the actual sidelines and in just in general!

I adore each and everyone of the Veiths, and I'm so happy Mary, Lisa, and you both could be with us tonight.

I hope you have an amazing time tonight!!
