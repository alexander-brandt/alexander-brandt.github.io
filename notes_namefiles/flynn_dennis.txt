Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Dennis,
I heard you didn't like your seat. Woof. I'll try and make dinner and speeches and stuff go as absolutely fast as possible so you don't have to tolerate the Morans for any longer than you have to.

You're freaking hilarious. I don't want it to go to your head, but you are. Good work on that. I hope you start doing more standup/improv, cause Alex and I will def hit that up and heckle you from the front row.

Godspeed, hope you get away from these people soon,
Casey
