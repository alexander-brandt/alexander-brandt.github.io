Liz,

Thank you so much for being with us today and your genuine enthusiasm over this past year for our wedding!  I have always been humbled by your and George's support for my career and life.  You made a shaky transition to NYC a lot more fun and friendly and and its been fun to see our paths criss-cross along the East Coast.  I am so thankful for what a beautiful life you have built with one of my best friends -- you make him happy and complete in a way I would wish for anyone and everyone.  Looking forward to dancing the night away with your both tonight and seeing lots more of you both in 2023!

Best,

Alexander
