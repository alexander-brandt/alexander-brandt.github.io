To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!


Varun, 

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. It means so much that you are here!!! Especially after the breakfast we had up at your place... Alex was like "I love that guy Varun, we have so many common interests!" We'll have to get together more in 2023!!!

Wherever you go, you bring such an amazing energy. I hope you and Priya enjoy a parents-night-out and let loose.

Cheers to 2023!!
