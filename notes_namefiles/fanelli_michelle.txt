WESSEL GIRLS!!!!!!

I love my sisters but beyond that, you guys are the absolute epitome of #sistergoals!!!!

I adore being around each and everyone one of you. From your dances at such a young age to the musicals to holidays to HH's... I am so lucky to have such fun cousins like you!!!

Michelle,
I want to come back and take dance class with CJ and Stella!! You look like you're the best teacher in the whole world!!!
Thank you for being the sweetest, most supportive cousin around. You're always quick to send a happy birthday or "checking in" text - I so appreciated it after Tommy! Even when you are so so busy, you always are putting other people first. What an amazing quality!
I hope you have an AMAZING time tonight -- I'll be copying each and every one of your moves on the dance floor!!
