Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Connor,
I remember when you were born. Katie cried a lot at my house. You turned out okay, though.
In fact, you're actually really cool. Thanks for not freaking out too much when I came to teach at your school your senior year. I love going out with you, even if you do try and start beef with me and Bern.

Please control your end of the table tonight. Those Maloneys are wildcards.
