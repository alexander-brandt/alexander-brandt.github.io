Robert,

Thank you so much for being with Alex and me to celebrate tonight! I know its not always easy to sneak away with Chase, but I really appreciate you choosing to party and countdown to midnight with us. 

Katie has been such an amazing friend to so many people over the years, and I am so honored to be one of them. Your partnership with her has made her so happy, and I have adored watching you hit all different milestones -- marriage, a house, a son -- you all do it so beautifully!!!

Thank you for being such a great role model for Alex and me as we continue on our journey together. We look forward to many drinks, celebrations, and dinners to come.
