To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, amazing, and everything in between sides. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

Kat,
You are the most amazing human being in the world!!! Your joy, positivity, and resilience is truly outstanding. No matter what the world throws your way, I continue to be amazed at how selfless you are. Thank you for always checking in on me, making time for me, and loving me!

I have so adored watching you and Jason grow the Rathje unit. I so look forward to watching the twins grow in years to come. Hopefully they'll have new Brandt buddies soon!!

Thank you for making this weekend the best ever!!!!
