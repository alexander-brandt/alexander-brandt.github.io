Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and me tonight.

Mrs. Wheeler,

Thank you SO much for traveling back to DC to be with us tonight to celebrate. I am so grateful to have you here. My love for the entire Wheeler clan is boundless - please give everyone a big hug for me!!

See you on the dance floor!!
