Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Margaret-

As the first non-sister to lead the cousins... marrying Ryan, having Mac, navigating the whole "splitting holidays" thing... I've truly been impressed with how you seem to do it all and make it look effortless!! It shouldn't surprise me, as you've always been so impressive since you're early Mount and Brown days, but still.... I love watching you take life by storm (and always do it in the BEST style). 

Thanks for being here to celebrate tonight -- we're so excited to be surrounded by the best family around!!
