Jon!!!

Thank you for being such an amazing friend to Alex for a bazillion years... and thank you for being so welcoming, loving, and supportive to me for this past year and a half!

From date 2 I heard about Jon, Emily, and Jeff. Honestly it might even have been date 1, but that one's a bit of a blur. Alex gives you credit for so many of his successes - your support, advice, and listening and watchful presence has meant so much to him. I adore your two's friendship, and I"m so grateful for it!

Living in the UWS with you all so close has been a ball. I cannot wait to continue our adventures in Hoboken - thanks for clearing a path for us! Watching you and Emily grow into your new parenthood stage with Eliza has been such a treat. You're truly doing it all!!

Thank you for bringing such amazing energy and enthusiasm to this weekend, I so so appreciate it.

See you on the dance floor!!
