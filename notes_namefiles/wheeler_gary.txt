Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and I tonight.


Mr. Wheeler,

Thank you so much for being here with me tonight!! My CYO days with you as my coach are some of my favorites growing up. What a squad!!! 
Thank you and Mrs. Wheeler for always showing up - even when it's traveling from Florida - and being the life of the party.  I am so grateful to have you with us on my big day. 

See you on the dance floor!!
