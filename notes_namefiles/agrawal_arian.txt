Arian!!!!

Mama's night OUT!!! You look FABULOUS and I hope you feel fabulous!! You have been bringing the party since 2006, and I'm hoping tonight is absolutely no exception!!

Over the past 16 years, I have cherished all our memories together. Whether is was having you as an honorary member of the downstairs quad, living with our last semester, visiting you all over the last decade, to now having you finally move to NYC - I know I'll always have fun with you.

I continue to be inspired by your work ethic -- Ar, you always go ALL IN to whatever you are doing, and it's been amazing to watch. I was so proud with your work at Riya, I'm SO proud of your work at being a mama right now, and I cannot wait to see what your next moves will be.

I look forward to living in the same city for at least a few more years - and hopefully on the same coast for decades to come! Cheers to new adventures, new memories, and lots of love and support.
