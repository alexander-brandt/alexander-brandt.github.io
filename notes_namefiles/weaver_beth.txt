DG!!!

The grand "Flynn-ale"! Our last wedding is here!!

Since Lindsay's wedding so many ions ago (epic) to all our other amazing celebrations of all shapes and sizes all over the country (&Italy!), it has been heartwarming to watch each of you get married. It has been equally fun to watch you all become moms (so excited for March!!). 

Whether I have seen you a lot due to proximity (Chicago, DC, NYC) or only a few times a year at our gatherings, I know I can text each of you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you all since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are each here 20 years later to celebrate!!


Bethy!!
You and Nick are killing it!! Your NJ life with your precious Kit and Jack looks like a ball - you deserve all of it and more!
Thanks for your kindness, generosity, encouragement, and laughter throughout these many years. I am so happy you are here to celebrate with me tonight!!
