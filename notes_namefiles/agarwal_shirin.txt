Shirin,

Can you believe it's been 16 years since our Next House and McCormick days?? We've come a longggg way since ChiPhi rush parties and Aphi shenanigans. 

The decade between Boston and my eventual NYC move was wild and so fun to have visited you here. The weddings, bachelorettes, birthdays, and random NYC reunions have always been so fun, and watching yours and Ashish's relationship grow has been special to watch. 

I love chatting Education with you, and you've especially kept me sane in that regard these last three years. Even though we come from opposite coasts, I often feel that you really "get me" in a way that I can't quite explain. I feel like we see things really similarly, and I love getting your opinion and just chatting about life. 

I'm not sure how long either of us will be in NYC, but I am grateful for the (minimum) 1-2 more years that we will have!! From there, I'm sure our friendship will then evolve yet again... but if we've made it 16 years, I have faith we have a lot of fun adventures in our future!!!

Thanks for being an amazing friend, a critical sounding board, and a great cheerleader.
