Maloney girls - 

All four of you are absolutely batshit crazy. If you date any man and tries to tell you differently, RUN, because he's a liar.

With that being said, I'm also batshit crazy, which is why I probably like you guys so much!!!!! Thanks for bringing the BEST energy to any room you come into. I better see you all on the dance floor (with bar breaks) all. Night. long. ... I'm counting on you!!!

Madeline!
I cannot believe you've been in New York this long and I haven't seen you! Hoboken block party ASAP when we get back from our honeymoon!!!

I hope you literally never stop telling stories. You ALWAYS have me laughing. I hope you have an amazing time tonight; if Miley comes on, hey, I knew what I was getting into when I invited you to the wedding, so that's on me.
