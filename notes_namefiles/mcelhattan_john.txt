Dear John,

It was so nice to meet you this weekend! Obviously, we did not have any photos together that I could give you.

The only logical thing I could do would be to include the most epic photo of Hannah I could get my hands on. I give you: the best Halloween costume to ever exist. The evolution of Brittany spears. I think Hannah nailed her trashy KFed stage quite well, don't you??

I hope you have a great time - welcome to the party!

Casey
