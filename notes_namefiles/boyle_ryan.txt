Ryan -

I remember your wedding like it was yesterday!! How do you already have two toddlers!?!?!?

I am so excited to have you and Lauren here with me to celebrate tonight!!! You are so very, very loved by the Flynn family. I have not seen as much of you and Lauren as I would like these past few years, but after a 30+ year friendship, I"m not concerned -- visiting with you all is like no time has passed.

Thank you so much for celebrating our big day with us and for your friendship, love, and support. 

Cheers to amazing 2023 and all the new memories and adventures it will bring!!
