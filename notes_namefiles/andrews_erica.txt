Dear Ian and Erica,

Welcome to our wedding! We are so happy that you could make it and be a part of our special day.

Ian, I remember those late nights in the Reg or Max Palevsky study rooms, huddled over our computer science textbooks, trying to decipher coding languages and algorithms.  I couldn't have made it through those classes without your help, Ian.  Luckiy we had plenty of action movies and bourbon to salve our wounds - Die Hard and Top Gun will always hold a special place in our friendship.

Erica, even as undergrads I knew you were a tenacious worker and fierce advocate for others.  I am in awe of your dedication to making the world a better place as a lawyer. Your passion and drive are truly inspiring.

We are so grateful to have both of you in our lives and can't wait to celebrate with you on our big day. We hope you have a great time and enjoy the dancing!

Thank you for being a part of our journey and we can't wait to see what the future holds for all of us.

With love,

Alexander
