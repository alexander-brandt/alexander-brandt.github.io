Dear Terri and Gordon,

We are so excited that you are able to join us on our special day! Your warmth and hospitality have meant so much to me, especially during the early days of our relationship when we were getting to know each other and your family.

Our first meeting at that Spanish restaurant in NYC will always be a memorable one, and I am so grateful for your warm invitations to all the dinner parties and wine tastings you have invited us to at your beautiful home in Chatham. Your kindness and generosity have made me feel so welcome, and I am so thankful to have you as a part of our lives.

Your three children have also been wonderful to me, and I are so grateful for their warm and welcoming spirits.  They definitely take after their parents.  We are looking forward to spending the day with all of you and celebrating this special occasion.

Thank you for being such a special part of our lives and for making me feel like I am truly part of the family.

We can't wait to celebrate with you both and dance the night away!

With love,

Alexander
