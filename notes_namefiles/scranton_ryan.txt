Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Ryan,
Dads night out!!!!! I hope you're having a ball and that you're still awake -- I'm sure you and Haley have had some long nights chasing around CJ and keeping Nicole fed, changed, and well. I know it's not alway easy to sneak away with young kids at home, so THANK YOU for being with us tonight.

Your love for Haley makes me so happy, and I love catching up with you over the holidays. Thanks for being an A+ addition to the fam.

See you on the dance floor - especially during Rosalita!!
