Dear George,

I can't believe it's been 18 years since we met in Potomac's classrooms.  Out of all my friends here you have probably known me the longest... and definitely walked/run the most miles with!

I remember a few New Year's Eves ago when I met Liz.  It has been so wonderful to watch your love blossom and your life grow together.  I cannot thank you enough for sharing this day with Casey and me and all the support you have shown me over the years.  Wether you were driving me after XC practice back to 218 Park St or letting me crash on your couch in Brooklyn before my Evercore interview, you've always been a steadfast friend who has wanted the best for me and helped me to achieve my goals with a big heart and a steady mind.  Looking forward to partying our brains off tonight and seeing lots of each other in 2023.

All my love,

Alexander
