Mr. and Mrs. Easby-Smith,

Thank you SO much for being with Alex and me tonight to celebrate. Your friendship with my parents over the past many years has been so special for them, and I absolutely love hearing about what all the Easby-Smith girls are up to!! 

The Columbia connection to the Brandts was just the icing on the cake. Small world getting smaller.

Thank you so much for all your love and support to the whole Flynn clan. I hope you have an amazing night and a great 2023!!
