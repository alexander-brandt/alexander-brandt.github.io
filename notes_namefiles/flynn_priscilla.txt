Dear Aunt Priscilla,

I thought of brining you in on this secret project of ours so I could get some old time photos... but alas, you have already done so much to help us that I wanted to try and do one thing without your help!!

I miss you dearly up in NYC. It is not quite the same not to have a "home away from home" at the office. You were such a sounding board for me for 6 years - thank you for your guidance, love, and support. You were always my #1 fan!

Thank you always for brining such energy everywhere you go. Your positivity is the trait I admire most, and I aspire to bring that into life with Alex!

I hope you have an amazing night - I love you!!
