Dear Uncle Danny,

Happy New Years Eve!!! Thanks for being here with Alex and me to celebrate -- we are so excited to be with everyone!!

Thank you for all your amazing love and support over the years. The Flynn boys have always been such a great example of putting family-first; the way that you have kept the beach and holiday traditions alive is a true testament to Grandmother Flynn and the values she instilled in each of you.

Thanks for always being so fun-loving as well. I adore a good backyard fire and all the other shenanigans your kids bring. 

I hope you have an amazing time tonight!!
