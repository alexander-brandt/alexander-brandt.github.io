Katie-

My love!! I don't even know where to begin with this note. I could go on forever, but I will mostly just say thank you, thank you, thank you for being one of the absolute best friends in the world.

From our MIT years where you were welcoming, fun-loving, never judgmental, always inclusive, and so caring & understanding... to now when you are ALL those things but add to it an inspiring workout buddy, a kickerass UnCommon director, and loving wife.

I am so grateful for the enthusiasm that you bring to every stage in life. Kate, you have always been my biggest cheerleader! From running for president, to taking on teaching, to navigating the dating pool... you are always checking in, always shining the spotlight, and always caring.

I love you so much and I'm so excited that you have found Josh. I don't know where 2023 will bring you, but I know that together you will be able to take on whatever challenges and adventures that come your way.

Thanks for being by my side to celebrate with me and Alex!
