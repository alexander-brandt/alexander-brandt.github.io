To my favorite McCarthys--

Omgosh I can't believe all 7 of the McCarthys are here to celebrate!!! It has been such fun to watch you all grow up -- from Michael's freshmen year to his 5th year at Fairfield... it's been a wild ride!! It is an honor to have you all with me tonight.

Sunday nights at your home were always hilarious -- sometimes routine... planning classes, keeping up with homework, finishing projects -- sometimes absolutely batshit crazy... someone had an exam they hadn't started studying for, a project that was late, the usual.... It was endlessly entertaining and sometimes weirdly stressful. 

RYAN!
Dude.. I'm so so so proud of you. You were always one of the most thoughtful McCarthys... from bringing me iced coffee to asking how my day was, I appreciate the time that you take to check in on those around you. You have so many people rooting for you -- ALWAYS feel like you can text if you need anything at all!!! 

I love having you with me tonight to celebrate - have an amazing start to 2023!!!
