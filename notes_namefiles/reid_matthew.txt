Matthew,

This is oddly enough one of the last notes that I wrote. I kept getting to your name and said "eh, I'll write it later."

But here were are -- I love you so very much! You are like the older brother I never had. You saw me at my good, my bad, my ugly, and my very ugly. You are endless forms of entertainment, laughter, and awe. I'm so proud of all the work that you do around the world. I'm very nervous for you, of course, but I know that you are making the world a better place, so for that I am thankful!!

Thank you for always including me when I was little in some of your shenanigans -- it gave me a confidence that was sometimes sorely needed. Thank you for ALWAYS showing up. It meant the world to me that you came up to NYC to meet Alex!!!!

I hope you have an amazing night tonight - cheers to a great start to 2023!!
