WESSEL GIRLS!!!!!!

I love my sisters but beyond that, you guys are the absolute epitome of #sistergoals!!!!

I adore being around each and everyone one of you. From your dances at such a young age to the musicals to holidays to HH's... I am so lucky to have such fun cousins like you!!!

Hales,
You are absolutely KILLING the mama game. I am so happy for you and Ryan and the adorable family that you are creating together. You are leading team Wessel with a fearless attitude that you have always possessed. 
Thanks for FOREVER making me laugh when you're around -- you are a GEM!

Have such an amazing time tonight - you deserve it!!
