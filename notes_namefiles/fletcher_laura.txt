Laura-

Thank you SO MUCH for being here tonight to celebrate with Alex and me!! It means the world to have 5/6 of the OG Apps here tonight. I know it's especially hard to travel with a little one at home and during the holidays (especially with the cold front we just had!) so I especially appreciate it.

Our Flynn-App family trips will forever go down in the books as some of my favorite adventures ever. Our parents are kinda nutty and very awesome at the same time. What a hoot! Celebrating yours and Rich's wedding in Colorado was so special, and then to do it again almost a decade later for Sarah a year and a half ago brought it full circle.

Thank you for your many years of friendship -- I hope you have an amazing time tonight and cheers to all that 2023 will bring!!!
