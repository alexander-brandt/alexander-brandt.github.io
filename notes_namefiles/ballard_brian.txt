Brian!!!!


If tonight is 50% as fun as your wedding was, I'll be happy!!!! Best night ever!!

It is so fun to have the whole crew here tonight -- you and Betsy are two of my favorite people to hang with -- thanks for always bringing the fun! Yours and Bets' love for adventure reminds me so much of Alex and I. I cannot wait for many years of story-swapping and getting recommendations from you on places to go.

Even though you seem mid-west bound, you do an amazing job at showing up to things. Some people take it for granted, because its partially just what our family does, but it means a lot to me so THANK YOU for always making the effort.

Cheers to another amazing Wessel/Flynn/Ballard wedding - thanks for celebrating with us!!!
