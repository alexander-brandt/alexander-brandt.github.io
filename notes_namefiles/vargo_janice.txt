Dear Janice,

Whew!  We did it!  Thank you so much for not only taking care of Casey during her bachlorette, dress fitting, and all the wedding events, but also keeping an eye on my two little sisters.  Casey's and my very early conversations were all about our families -- our siblings in particular -- and she could not stop gushing about what a wonderful example you were not just for the Flynn siblings but your cousins as well.  

The love and care you show to your family is truly inspiring. You are an incredible role model and I am so grateful to have you in my life.  It has been such a privledge to get to know you, Frank, and your three amazing kids.  Looking forward to many gatherings and adventures between all of us and team Flynn!

Best,

Alex
