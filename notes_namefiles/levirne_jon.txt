To my lovely Visitation husbands,

Thank you so much for coming to celebrate with Alex and me tonight!!! My friendship with these girls over the past 16 years has meant so much to me.... and to have each of them with me tonight means the world!!

I have loved celebrating your alls love, successes, triumphs, and joys - thank you for making us girls so happy!!!

I am counting on you all to be the life of the party - you dads (or soon-to-be dads) should be letting loose!!!

See you on the dance floor
