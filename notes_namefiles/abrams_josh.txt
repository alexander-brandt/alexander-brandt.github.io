Josh,

I believe these are some pictures of your first APhi wedding. You were such a good sport, I was so impressed with your ability to go with the flow!! Now your are at another first; this time, your first APhi wedding as a HUSBAND (that isn’t yours)!!!  I hope you’re enjoying life on the "other side." 

I can’t tell you how happy I am that you have made your way into our quirky little crew. You make our Katie SO HAPPY!!! She, as you know, is the absolute best — and you seem to be the absolute best for her! Your support and love for each other is palpable, and it warms my heart to see how happy she is with you.

It has been really fun to get to know you as a person (not just an BF/SO) as well! I especially am drawn to your love of photography and cooking! Your brisket was absolutely amazing, and your honeymoon pictures were out of this world!! You continue to amaze me with you different talents, interests, and hobbies.

I am so happy that you were able to take the time to be here with Alex and me on our big day. I cherish my friendship with Katie, and I am so looking forward to continuing our friendship and building new memories!!

Cheers to an amazing 2023 - wherever that takes you!!
