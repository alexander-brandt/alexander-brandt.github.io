Maloney girls - 

All four of you are absolutely batshit crazy. If you date any man and tries to tell you differently, RUN, because he's a liar.

With that being said, I'm also batshit crazy, which is why I probably like you guys so much!!!!! Thanks for bringing the BEST energy to any room you come into. I better see you all on the dance floor (with bar breaks) all. Night. long. ... I'm counting on you!!!

Gen,
I'm sad you left me in NYC but I love how you are absolutely slaying it at Maryland. I cannot believe you're almost done!!!

You have the third child energy that makes me proud. You take life by storm and you look hot doing it. 

I hope you never again feel abandoned or neglected. Happy Birthday on April 9, Genevieve Marie!!!

Xoxox,
Casey
