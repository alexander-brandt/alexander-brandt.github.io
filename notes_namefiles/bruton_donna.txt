Mr. and Mrs. Bruton,

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure where that is. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to be a part of an amazing neighborhood and friend group like the one you guys have!!

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you here with Alex and me tonight.

Please give my love to all three Bruton girls and their families, and I will see you out on the dance floor!!
