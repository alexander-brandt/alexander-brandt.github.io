Betsy-

I couldn't ask for a better addition to our family than you!! We hit the jackpot 800%!!!!!!!

Thanks for bringing such a fun-loving attitude to literally everything you do. Whether you're singing Wicked, bouncing around with a ribbon in your hair, or just cheering everyone else on -- you are such a joy to be around.

Thank you so much for being with Alex and I to celebrate tonight. You and Brian do such an amazing job at showing up for everyone. Your family-first attitude permeates everything you do, and I so admire it.

I can't wait to see you on the dance floor!!!!!!
