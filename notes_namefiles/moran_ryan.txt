Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Ryan,
You were the first besides my fearless brothers-in-law, and you handled it with such grace!! Thanks so much for bringing such fun to the Flynn clan. I love talkings sports, golf, Argyle, Olney, and all things Mac with you. 

Thank you for being her to celebrate with Alex and me tonight - it means the world to us!!
