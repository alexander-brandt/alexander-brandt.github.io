CAM-BAM!

You are the best of us.  You were always a fun and friendly little kid as we were growing up, but your character and kindness were undeniable.  When we were all in Spain two years ago, I had SO MUCH fun with you at our dinners and excursions.  I love the way you root for your siblings and bring a joyful attitude to all of your endevors.  Thank you for joining Casey and me today -- today would not be the same without you!

Best,

Alex
