WESSEL GIRLS!!!!!!

I love my sisters but beyond that, you guys are the absolute epitome of #sistergoals!!!!

I adore being around each and everyone one of you. From your dances at such a young age to the musicals to holidays to HH's... I am so lucky to have such fun cousins like you!!!

Jilly!!!
If my wedding can be half as fun as yours, it will be an amazing success!! OMGOD did you guys look like straight MODELS~!!!!
I have loved watching you perform - you have SUCH a presence on the stage!! Lukas has been so so fun to get to know over the past few years as well... Im so happy you all are so close!

I hope to see you both more - on stage and at a HH - in 2023. Have an amazing night and thank you so much for celebrating with us!!!
