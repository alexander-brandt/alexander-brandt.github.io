Doug,

Thank you for lending your kitchen to me for hours upon hours on end. My catch up with your wife are some of my favorite visits -- I know they tend to go a little longer than planned, so thank you for both your cameos and your patience :) 

I love hearing about your golf trips with my dad. It cracks Helen up to no end to say that "our dads are on a golf trip." Go on, try it - I bet she'll start cracking up right after you say it!! :) 

Thank you so much for being with me tonight - it is such an honor to have such good friends with Alex and me to celebrate.

Cheers to more laughter and fun in 2023!
Casey
