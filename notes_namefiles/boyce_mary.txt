Dear Mary,

I am so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration!  You are the sweetest and kindest person I have ever met, and I am so grateful to have enjoyed your love of music, fun, and family as I grew up.

Papa, who loved you and Bill so much, often describe you as "Uncle Bill's angel" -- your dedication is something I hope to emulate for Casey.  I will be lucky to emulate even a sliver of your strength and grace.

Although we may not see each other as frequently as we would like, the conversations we have had have always been meaningful and memorable. I am so lucky and thankful for your presence in my life and the love and wisdom you have shared with me.

We can't wait to celebrate our love with you.  Please save me a dance tonight!

With love and gratitude,

Alexander
