BRIDGE!!!!!!!

I can write this with confidence without even having seen you... you look STUNNING tonight!! Thanks for always bringing your "A" game to whatever party we're having... I love your enthusiasm and your energy.

You have gone from my little cousin that I adore to a grown-ass woman who I admire! Your cross-country move was wild and out there -- just my style. I'm so excited for you and all the adventures you will rack up. 

Thanks for being such an amazing hype woman -- from the very beginning, you were so welcoming to Alex and let me know how much you loved him. It meant the world to me and helped us both be at ease.

I love you SO MUCH and can't wait to see you on the DANCE FLOOR!!!

Xoxox,
Casey
