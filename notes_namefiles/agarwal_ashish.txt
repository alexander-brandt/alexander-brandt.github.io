Ashish-

If this wedding is 50% as fun as your wedding was... I'll call it a GREAT SUCCESS!!!!

Thank you so much for being here to celebrate with Alex and I. Since I first started dating Alex, you have always been so warm and welcoming. I was nervous to bring my first (and only) boyfriend around, but you have a sincerity and warmth about you that puts everyone at ease. Thank you for being so kind!!

You and Shirin are one of my absolute favorite couples to hang with. You guys have a great partnership and I love observing that while your schedules and priorities have been altered by Anaya, you still remain your true fun selves. Your work ethic, integrity, and family-values have really inspired me -- quite simply... you are awesome!!!

Thanks for always brining the fun -- I'll see you on the dance floor tonight!!!!
