Dear Aunt Jan and Uncle Bob,

One of the nicest things some people have said about Alex and me is how well our strengths compliment one another. 

When I think of you two, that is exactly how I think of you!! You both have such amazing skills and character traits that are quite different from one another, but together, you make a fiercely powerful couple!! Not many people can take on all that you have done, and I am always so impressed by you!

Thank you for all that you have done for our family at large and for always showing up. I know it may seem that we Marylanders take it for granted, but I am really appreciative of your many travels to celebrate and be with everyone. 

Aunt Jan - I hope to hear your laughter all night long!!!
