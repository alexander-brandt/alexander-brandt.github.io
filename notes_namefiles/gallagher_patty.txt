Buddy and Patty,

When I look at this photo above of my dad's 40th birthday party, I think, what a beautiful friendship of 30+ years!!

Now, here you are, after 60+ years of friendship. What an amazing and special feat. Thank you for your friendship to my dad and thank you for being with us to celebrate tonight. 

Happy New Years Eve!!!
Casey
