Kelly- 

I'm so excited to be your new neighbor!! Hoboken here we come!! 

You don't get to choose who marries into your family... but as I told Betsy... we hit the jackpot with you!!

The day after yours and Drew's wedding, Alex was planning on asking my dad for his permission to marry me. Sitting at your and Drew's wedding, I knew it would be the last time I would be not-engaged/not-married. Your ceremony, the homily, your love -- it was so special to me!

Alex and I have almost the exact opposite relationship to you and Drew. We dated for 4 months... you've known each other since you were 4. Same same! 

However, the merging of two great families, the friendship and love, all of it is so similar, and admire you and Drew so much for the partnership you have created.

Thank you so much for being so warm and welcoming to Alex; we are so excited to have you here to celebrate with us!!!
