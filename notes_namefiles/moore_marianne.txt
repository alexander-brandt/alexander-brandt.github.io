Ms Moore--

I would love for you to take a look around you beautiful table. Besides Mrs. Gannon, you are such a big part of why this table exists!!

As I've now spent 13 years in education (man that went fast!!) I can confirm what most people probably already knew --- the school administration is the most important piece of a school!! I'm forever impressed with what an amazing school culture you created, from hiring and retaining teachers to attracting amazing families such as this -- thank you for making my childhood schooling first class, and thank you for helping to shape such a phenomenal community of people. 

Thank you also for the amazing friendship to my mom and to my whole family. I absolutely love catching up with you whenever I see you -- you have been my biggest fan and supporter and I so so appreciate it.

I hope you have a wonderful time tonight!!
