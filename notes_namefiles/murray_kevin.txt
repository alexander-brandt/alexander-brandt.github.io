Kevin and Lily,

I'm so excited that you guys are with us tonight!!!!! We have absolutely terrible photos together... we'll have to fix that at some point.

Kevin,
It is so fun to have such an old friend here tonight. After almost 30 years, we have seen a LOT of life stages! Thank you for being so kind and fun from grade school to high school to after college to now. I love the life you have made for yourself in NC!!

Lily, 
Kevin has never been so happy as when he is with you!!!! You are such an amazing addition to the Murray family... Mr&Mrs seemed ready to adopt you from day 1. I am so excited for your wedding next year -- HUGE congratulations to you both.

Have an amazing time tonight ringing in the new year. Cheers to all that 2023 will bring!!!
