Dear Uncle Kevin and Aunt Anne,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! As big supporters of Gonzaga High School and Casey and her former colleagues, you have always been a special part of our lives (before we even knew the other existed!). We have always appreciated the love and care that you show to one another and your children, and we have always admired your selfless and dedicated approach to parenting.

Anne, your sweet and joyful personality is truly contagious, and we have always enjoyed spending time with you and your siblings. We have especially enjoyed watching tennis together at the US Open and more recently Allie's lacrosse games.

Both of your strong Catholic faith and your dedication to your family have always been an inspiration to us, and we are grateful to have you as a part of our lives.

We can't wait to celebrate our love with you.

With love and gratitude,

Alex and Casey
