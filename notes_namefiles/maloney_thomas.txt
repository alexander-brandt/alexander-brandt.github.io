Yooooo - 

I don't know how you've made it this far with being the youngest Flynn cousin (Maryland based) and behind those three batshit crazy sisters of yours, but you're here and I'm proud of you!!!

I needed to head to NYC when I did, but dang I wish I had overlapped with you longer at Gonzaga. I'm so proud of all you accomplished there, and it was fun to see you and get to know a few of your friends when I did.

You're wicked smart and I'm pumped for your Middlebury career. Despite our age difference, I always love catching up with you and thoroughly enjoyed our tutoring sessions when you needed them.

Never hesitate to text about anything, Alex and I are always here for you! Have so much fun and please keep Daniel, Ben, and the McCarthy's in check. You're oddly enough the most adult at this table.
