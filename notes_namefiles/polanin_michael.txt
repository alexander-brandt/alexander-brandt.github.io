Dear Flynn/Polann cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Michael,
Thank you so much for coming to our wedding!!! It's so fun to have you in the DMV area -- I"m jealous that while you are here, I am gone!! Please stick around for awhile so we can overlap a bit!! I love going out with you and all the cousins and I hope we're able to do it more in 2023!
Have an amazing night - I requested some Bruce for you!
