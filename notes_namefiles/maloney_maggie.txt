Maloney girls - 

All four of you are absolutely batshit crazy. If you date any man and tries to tell you differently, RUN, because he's a liar.

With that being said, I'm also batshit crazy, which is why I probably like you guys so much!!!!! Thanks for bringing the BEST energy to any room you come into. I better see you all on the dance floor (with bar breaks) all. Night. long. ... I'm counting on you!!!

Maggie!!!
My honorary cousin - I'm so happy you are here! Thanks for making the cross-country flight and sticking around to celebrate. Alex loved chatting with you at Uncle Mike's, and I adore every time I see you. I'm so impressed with you kicking ass out in UCLA - keep up the amazing work but make sure you come back to the East Coast when you're done.

Cheers!!!
