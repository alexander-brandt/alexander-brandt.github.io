To my favorite McCarthys--

Omgosh I can't believe all 7 of the McCarthys are here to celebrate!!! It has been such fun to watch you all grow up -- from Michael's freshmen year to his 5th year at Fairfield... it's been a wild ride!! It is an honor to have you all with me tonight.

Sunday nights at your home were always hilarious -- sometimes routine... planning classes, keeping up with homework, finishing projects -- sometimes absolutely batshit crazy... someone had an exam they hadn't started studying for, a project that was late, the usual.... It was endlessly entertaining and sometimes weirdly stressful. 

Sean-
You have done such an amazing job at paving your own way at Holy Cross. I'm so proud of how you handled everything at Gonzaga -- covid at the end of your time there was not fun, but you persevered and didn't let it stop you from achieving your goals.  

Thank you so much for being here tonight - I hope you have an amazing 2023!!!
