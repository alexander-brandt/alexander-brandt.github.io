Dear Paul, Tommy, and Allie,

I am so excited to have you all join us at our wedding! Your presence means so much to us and we can't wait to celebrate this special day with you.  Frankly, this special day wouldn't have happened without your legacy making such a good introduction for me!  You carry your mother's and father's distinguished and kind spirit with you all wherever you go.  I am so lucky to be your cousin.

Paul, we are so proud of you for forging an exciting new chapter for yourself in Washington D.C. and thank you for always looking out for Trish when she comes into town. Your kindness and support means the world to us.

Allie, we are in awe of your impressive scholarship with Bucknell University and your varsity lacrosse accolades. Your dedication and hard work is truly inspiring.  We love watching you represent the Bisons on Hulu or in person!

Tommy, it's an honor to have you as a part of our wedding. Your kindness and talent as a singer made our special day complete.  Thank you for letting me name drop you to win the love of my life.

I can't wait to celebrate with all of you and are so grateful to have you as a part of our big day.

With love,

Alexander
