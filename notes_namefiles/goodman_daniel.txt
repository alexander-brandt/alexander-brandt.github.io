To my lovely Visitation husbands,

Thank you so much for coming to celebrate with Alex and me tonight!!! My friendship with these girls over the past 16 years has meant so much to me.... and to have each of them with me tonight means the world!!

I have loved celebrating your alls love, successes, triumphs, and joys - thank you for making us girls so happy!!!

Daniel - thank you especially for being so welcoming to Alex. It's hard to be the last to join the husband crew, and I really appreciate you being your kind, friendly self. 

I'm looking forward to buying the house on the other side of Kelly in 5 years. Start working on your neighbors!!!
