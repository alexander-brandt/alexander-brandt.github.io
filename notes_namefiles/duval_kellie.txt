Kellie!!!!

I am SO happy that you and Kevin were able to make it up here to celebrate!! I know that traveling over the holidays and with the kids is not the easiest, and I am so grateful that you were able to be with us tonight. Alex and I are both so appreciative!!

You have been the fearless older cousin since forever. Thanks for always letting me tagalong when I was little, and thank you for consistently making the effort to visit us in MD ever since. I love our visits from you, and I adore watching you and Kevin build your beautiful family down in NC.

I hope you have a wonderful night tonight!!!
