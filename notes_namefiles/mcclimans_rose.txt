DG!!!

The grand "Flynn-ale"! Our last wedding is here!!

Since Lindsay's wedding so many ions ago (epic) to all our other amazing celebrations of all shapes and sizes all over the country (&Italy!), it has been heartwarming to watch each of you get married. It has been equally fun to watch you all become moms (so excited for March!!). 

Whether I have seen you a lot due to proximity (Chicago, DC, NYC) or only a few times a year at our gatherings, I know I can text each of you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you all since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are each here 20 years later to celebrate!!

Rose!!
From giving me the nickname "Yeti" to watching Wicked in NYC to dinners at Nina May... I love you!! You are always the life of the party and you and Linds have done an amazing job at forging the way for us in motherhood.
I know NYE is a special night for restaurants but I'm so happy you could be with me tonight!
Love you!
