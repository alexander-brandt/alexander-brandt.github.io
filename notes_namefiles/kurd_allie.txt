DG!!!

The grand "Flynn-ale"! Our last wedding is here!!

Since Lindsay's wedding so many ions ago (epic) to all our other amazing celebrations of all shapes and sizes all over the country (&Italy!), it has been heartwarming to watch each of you get married. It has been equally fun to watch you all become moms (so excited for March!!). 

Whether I have seen you a lot due to proximity (Chicago, DC, NYC) or only a few times a year at our gatherings, I know I can text each of you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you all since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are each here 20 years later to celebrate!!

ALLIE!!!
If I can be 50% as positive as you, I will consider myself a success. I continue to admire you you ALWAYS make whomever you are with feel like a million bucks. 
I have adored watching you and Andrew make the most beautiful life with one another. I am so so happy for you and I am so grateful that you continue to share your successes and celebrate mine with me.
I love you so much - have an amazing Mama's night out!!!!
