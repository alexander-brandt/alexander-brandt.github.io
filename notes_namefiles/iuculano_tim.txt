Tim!!!!


You win the prize for potentially having my favorite all time picture. Fear the Turtle!!


Thank you SO MUCH for being here with Alex and me to celebrate tonight. It wouldn't have been the same without you!!!

Thank you for always taking care of me like your little sister. From teaching me how to parallel park in the driveway before my driving test to encouraging me each and every time you see me, you are everyone's greatest cheerleader. I'm so jealous that Colleen and Mike see you so frequently -- one more reason for me to move down to Maryland SOON!

Your capacity for love, positivity, and resilience is truly inspiring. Please know that you are an absolute favorite amongst every single one of the Flynns, now including Alex as well. We are all in your corner as your ride or dies. 

You sent me a text a month ago promising that a sweaty Italian would be on the dance floor. I'm cashing that promise in. See you out there!!
