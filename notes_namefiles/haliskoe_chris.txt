CHRISSSSSSS-

I hope you're enjoying your first Flynn wedding!! We're super weird but we're mostly harmless, and really fun!!! 

Thanks for being so welcoming to Alex and me in Hoboken. We are both SO PUMPED to be your new neighbor. We 100% plan to mooch off of your suggestions, St. Ann's friendships, and basically everything, because you seem like you have the set up!!! I know that it did not happen by accident... you seem purposeful in everything you do, and I so admire that quality!

Thanks for making our Mary Kate so happy. I am so glad that you are with here tonight.

Have an amazing time tonight, and cheers to more memories in 2023!
