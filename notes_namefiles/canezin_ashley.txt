Ashley!

I hope we can always celebrate Kevin's birthday so festively!

All jokes aside, I am so thankful to have met you and for the joy you bring to Kevin's life.  You are a tenacious and wonderful soul.  Casey and I are so thankful you can be here today to celebrate with us.  Cheers to many more adventures in NYC and beyond!

Sincerely,

Alex
