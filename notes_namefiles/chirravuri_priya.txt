To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

Priya,
You have now left your little one TWICE to come celebrate me and I am more appreciative than words can say!!! These past few years in NYC especially have been so fun to reconnect, celebrate you and & Varun and your growing life together, and enjoy life as adults.

Your ability to do it all truly inspires me. I am forever impressed with your work ethic and capacity to love your family. You are amazing!!

I love you!
