Sarah!!

Thank you so much for traveling all this way to be with us on our big day!! I am especially grateful since I know it's prob not as fun to not be here with Bryan -- I SO appreciate it!!

90% of my childhood memories have you in them. From talent shows, field days, surviving Ms. Schwab, Friday night sleepovers, CYO bball games, SJB, Resurrection, and St. E's dances... I could go on and on. I cherished our friendship and look back fondly over all our fun times - and that's not even getting into the Flapp trip memories!!!

As we grow older it has been so fun to hear consistent updates about where all the App children are from my mom. Seeing you in Colorado was a bright spot in a very dark Covid-era for me!! When I see you it is like no time has passed. 

I look forward to celebrating more milestones with you -- much love to you and Bryan and have an amazing 2023. 

See you on the dance floor!!
