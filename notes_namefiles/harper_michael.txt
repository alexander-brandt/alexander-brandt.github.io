Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and I tonight.

Mr. Harper - 

You were one of the first people to give me tips on where to stand at a wedding. Since then, I've properly scoped out the right place to stand (near the kitchen where they bring them out hot) and I've learned to become friends with the waiters so they always bring me back the good ones. I hope you were successful in this endeavor earlier this year.

Thank you so much for always keeping us Flynns laughing -- you are such a joy to have around and I'm so happy that you were here to celebrate with us tonight!!!
