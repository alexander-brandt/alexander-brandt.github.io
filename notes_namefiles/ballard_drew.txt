Drewwww- 

So pumped to be your neighbor!! Hoboken here we come!!!

I have forever loved your goofy, fun-loving, laid-back attitude. I still have a voicemail from you and Mary asking me where I was for your graduation party. You guys never fail to crack me up, and I know that I'll always have a good night if you're involved.

I've always known that I've been blessed to have the best family. I always looked forward to our holidays when we were little, and it's honestly so weird how old we are now. I'm sure some traditions will go by the wayside, but I look forward to building and continuing new ones.

Thank you for being so welcoming to Alex - he absolutely LOVES his time with the Ballards and feels so welcomed by you. I love you so much and I am so grateful for your friendship and support.
