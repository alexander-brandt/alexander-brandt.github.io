Dr. and Mrs. Salkeld,

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like the one pictured above!!!

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and me tonight.

Some of my absolute favorite memories of my childhood were played on your front lawn. What a joyful neighborhood we had!! Please give my love to Kevin, Steven, and their families and thank you for celebrating with us!!!
