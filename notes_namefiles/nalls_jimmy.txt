Kathy and Jimmy-

How special it is to have such lifelong friends as you here to celebrate me!! With your huge network of family and friends, it is SUCH an honor to have you with Alex and me tonight to celebrate. Thank you especially, Jimmy, for being on the altar this evening!!

My covid days on Manor Park Drive were not necessarily the brightest spot I've ever had, but my walks were always brightened with a quick hello from you on or a visit on your front lawn chairs. Thanks for being such a model of what a good friend and neighbor is -- someone to celebrate in the joys and to support in times of need.

I hope you have an amazing time tonight - cheers to 2023!!
