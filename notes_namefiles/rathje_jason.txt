To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!


Jason,

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. It means so much that you are here. It is the most genZ /cheesiest thing... but you and Kat are such #couplegoals and #familygoals. Your partnership is truly inspiring - you guys take everything in stride and make it look easy, although I know it is not.

Thank you for being SO welcoming when I have third wheeled with you over the years. I remember your celebration in Connecticut SO well and I hope that 10 years later, we can bring the same fun energy!

Have SO much fun tonight and thank you again for such amazing friendship and support!
