Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Ross,

You make Monica SO HAPPY which in turn, makes me so happy. I also absolutely love sitting next to you or near you during family holidays; your dry commentary makes me crack up!!

Thanks for celebrating Alex and me today - we appreciate it so much!!!

Xoxox,
Casey
