Dear Tim (aka "T" -- but let me know if you don't like that one),

I sometimes laugh that I have a secret (or not so secret) set of hobbies that occupy a large percentage of my thoughts.  While I rarely get to share my musings and observations, I am thankful when I occasionally do meet someone who shares my interests.  I find it incredible and humbling that the love of my life had a brother, so very near and dear to her heart, that can entertain and might even find delight (or at least amusement) in my fan castings, time travel theories, and quandries about 5e mechanics.  Beyond these admitedly fun surface-level intrigues, I feel lucky to have found such an incredible friend.  Thank you for your unending hospitality, your ability to show up and share yourself, and your presence today.  You are so precious to us.

Love,

Alex
