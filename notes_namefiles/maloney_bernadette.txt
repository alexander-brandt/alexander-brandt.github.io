Maloney girls - 

All four of you are absolutely batshit crazy. If you date any man and tries to tell you differently, RUN, because he's a liar.

With that being said, I'm also batshit crazy, which is why I probably like you guys so much!!!!! Thanks for bringing the BEST energy to any room you come into. I better see you all on the dance floor (with bar breaks) all. Night. long. ... I'm counting on you!!!

Bern,
As the first cousin to meet Alex, you should feel honored. It was purposeful! I was like she can be chill, let's do it. 

It's been awesome to watch you become an adult. I love having you up in NYC and I hope to see you more! You've got a great thing going, and I can't wait to see all the things you'll do; I see my adventurous spirit in you, and I LOVE it!

Cheers to starting off 2023 with a bang!!
Xoxoxo
