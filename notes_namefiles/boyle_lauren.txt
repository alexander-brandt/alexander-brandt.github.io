Lauren!!!!

Mama's night out... am I right!?!?!?

I cannot believe you just met Alex for the first time this weekend. I guess that's what happens when you date for .2 seconds, but still!!!

Thank you so much for being with me to celebrate tonight. Your friendship over the past 30 years has been so special. I love that no matter how much time has passed, we can just pick up like I saw you yesterday. Watching you meet Ryan, marry Ryan, and then have the 2 cutest kids with Ryan has brought me so much joy. I love your partnership and love, and I will forever be honored to have been a part of your day. 

While it may take 2-4 years for me to be back in DC, I look forward to that day so we can hang out more on the regular!!

Until then, I'll take tonight; so I will see you on the dance floor: break it down, mama!!!
