Dear Aunt Bridget and Uncle John,

Thank you for being with us tonight to celebrate!!! As an adult who has now traveled back and forth from NYC/NJ to the DMV, I extra appreciate all the effort you consistently put into making such the we saw the Polanin gang a ton. Your love of family is so evident in everything you do -- you truly live the virtue of "showing up." Whether you're coming in from New Jersey, Australia, or Ireland... thank you for being such an amazing support.

Every time I see you both, you have such words of encouragement for me. Whether it is about how cool my New York neighborhood was or pumping me up about my dress, you both have the amazing quality of making me (and others) feel better about themselves. Thank you!

I hope you have a WONDERFUL night tonight and cheers to more celebrations in 2023 and beyond!
