Dear Kelly,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! Your bubbly and enthusiastic personality has made such a positive impact on Casey's and my lives, and we are grateful to have you as a friend.

Your kindness towards me and my sisters as we have gotten to know the Flynn's and Casey's Visitation friends has meant so much to me. Your interest in new and fun hobbies and your dedication to making everyone feel welcome and included at social events is so wonderful.  Congratulations on your beautiful new house with Andrew, and on the arrival of your precious new baby, Owen. We had so much fun at his baptism, and we are excited to see what the future holds for you and your family.

Thank you for being such a wonderful and supportive friend to Casey over the years. We can't wait to celebrate our love with you.

Sincerely,

Alexander
