Liz!

It feels like just yesterday we were celebrating one of Adde's early birthdays at the Delerium brewpub.  That lunch stands out so singularly in my memory.  You have such a wonderful family, and I am so inspired by your love for Donald and your beautiful children.

When Casey and I were first hanging out on the NC beach, you and Donald pulled up your chairs and made everyone feel at home.  That to me is unsurprising, as your hospitality is a signature of warmth, friendship, and celebration.  I am thankful for your presence today as Casey and I begin this journey.  We love you so much!

Best,

Alexander
