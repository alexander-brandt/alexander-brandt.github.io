Abby,

Thank you for always being the life of the party, no matter where you are. When I think of "Abby Albright" I think of someone who is a constant cheerleader for others. It's not a coincidence that you have 5 million friends... it is because YOU are a good friend to so many people!! It brings a tear to my eye every time you check in on Baby Anna's anniversary... you celebrate the birthdays and you check-in on the hard times... a true testament to your character. 

It's a little hard to believe that we're here at my wedding. Just 4 years ago I lived with you during a really rough 6 month stretch for me. I wasn't in a great space, but living with you and Maggie was just what I needed -- you were both so kind, welcoming, and accepting. THANK YOU for seeing me through that life hump.

Abs, I won't dwell on this long but I would be remiss not to mention it -- you have truly inspired me these past few years. Your unwavering care and love for you Mom, your dad, and your family at large has been so, so, SO inspiring. She is so proud of you. 

Thank you SO MUCH for coming to celebrate with me - I'll see you on the dance floor SOON!!!!
