Dear Mr. and Mrs. Flynn,

Thank you so much for this incredible day.  I knew almost immediately after I met Casey that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.  It might have felt crazy to say out loud at the time, but looking back it makes perfect sense.  She is one of the smartest, hardest working, and ethical people I have ever had the privledge of meeting.  She's also fun, joyful, with a spark of sassiness that makes every day a new adventure.  After I met you both, I realized all of these amazing qualities came from you two and her upbringing.  And, like with Casey, after a dinner or family gathering with you both my heart feels lighter and my soul feels stronger.

Mrs. Flynn, I don't know if anyone has ever welcomed me more warmly into any group.  You exude such a natural goodness and kindness it is almost impossible to not smile when you are around.  When I stay at your house I can literally feel myself skipping up the stairs into the kitchen to share a cup or coffee or slice of banana bread.

Mr. Flynn, your devotion to your family is awe-inspiring.  I hope to emulate your example as I grow into a husband and (God willing) a father.  You are a wonderful conversationalist, a generous host, and genuinely one of the funniest people I have ever met.  I have so much to learn from you and I welcome every opportunity to do so -- so keep those e-mails, NYT/WSJ articles, and texts coming!

This wedding has been beyond anything I could have ever imagined in my wildest dreams.  Thank you for your profound and immense generosity.  I love your daughter more than anything the world and I promise to strive without ceasing to both support her calling to a holy and virtuous life and make her the happiest woman alive.

All my love,

Alex
