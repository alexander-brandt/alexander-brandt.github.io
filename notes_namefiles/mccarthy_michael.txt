To my favorite McCarthys--

Omgosh I can't believe all 7 of the McCarthys are here to celebrate!!! It has been such fun to watch you all grow up -- from Michael's freshmen year to his 5th year at Fairfield... it's been a wild ride!! It is an honor to have you all with me tonight.

Sunday nights at your home were always hilarious -- sometimes routine... planning classes, keeping up with homework, finishing projects -- sometimes absolutely batshit crazy... someone had an exam they hadn't started studying for, a project that was late, the usual.... It was endlessly entertaining and sometimes weirdly stressful. 

Michael,
As the leader of the clan, you have done such an amazing job of being the trailblazer for your siblings. I'm so proud of all your work at Loyola and I love that you're now at Fairfield with the crew!! I hope you have a WONDERFUL time tonight!!
