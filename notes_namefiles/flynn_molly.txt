Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Molly,
During our SJB years, 2 years seemed like an eternity away. As we've gotten older, it's been so fun to have such a cool cousin my age. Whether its been shenanigans on Corocran street or swapping teaching stories, I always love hanging with you over a glass of wine and hearing a funny Sandra story.
I hope you have an amazing time tonight - I can't wait to see what dress you're wearing because you ALWAYS look fire!!!
