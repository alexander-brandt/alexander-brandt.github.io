Dear Aunt Mik,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding! Your presence means so much to us and we can't wait to celebrate this special day with you.

You have always been such a supportive and loving person, especially when it came to my academic interests. Every Christmas as a child I asked for myriad books and I always found them wrapped up at Grandpa and Mimi's Christmas with your handwriting on the gift tag.  Your kindness and hospitality at family gatherings has created so many memorable moments for me, and I am so grateful to have you join us today.

I know we both share a love of history, especially United States history, and I have always admired your keen mind and memory.  One family dinner (I think it was Easter), someone said "I don't think anyone who served as president ever served in the house or senate after they left office."  Without missing a beat, we both said at the same time "John Quincy Adams!"  Everyone else at the table looked at us like we were crazy, but we couldn't stop laughing.

Casey and I can't wait to celebrate with you and are so grateful to have you as a part of our special day.  I love you so much.

Alexander
