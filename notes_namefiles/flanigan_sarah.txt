Dear Sarah,

Thank you so much for joining us today to celebrate our wedding!

I have so many fond memories of you and your amazing children at our house on Park Street and ContourGlobal events.  My Dad thinks the world of the work you do.  Thank you for being such a close friend to my parents.  I hope you enjoy yourself tonight and have a great time ringing in the New Year!

Best,

Alex
