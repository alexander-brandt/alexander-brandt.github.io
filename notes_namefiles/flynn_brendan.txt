Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Brendan,
You've been my OG cousin friend from day 1. Thanks for leading the pack from the boys perspective, helping to carry on all the traditions, and just overall being fun. We'll have to sneak away to take a shot tonight and pretend its 2005 Christmas Eve.
