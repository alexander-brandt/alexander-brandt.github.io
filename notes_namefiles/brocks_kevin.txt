Dear Baby Bird,

Cannot believe we are here today.  From the first time I met you I knew you were a special and singular individual -- a unique soul that combined a love of learning and a love of life.  I couldn't be happier that you are here with us to celebrate this magnificent occasion.

Thank you for every coffee walk, late night rooftop beer, and holiday gastronomy triumph.  I know we have so many amazing times ahead of us and I cannot wait for every second.

Best,

Alexander
