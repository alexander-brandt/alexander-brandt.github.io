Dear Caroline and Ben,

We are so excited to have you both join us at our wedding! Your enthusiasm and fun-loving spirit is always a joy to be around, and we know that your presence will add such happiness to our special day.

Congratulations on your beautiful home! We can't wait to hear all about it and celebrate this exciting new chapter in your lives. And of course, we can't wait to cheer on the Capitals with you next time we are in DC or Reston.

We can't wait to celebrate with you and are so grateful to have you as a part of our special day.

With love,

Alex and Casey
