Brian!!!!

I'm so excited you're here to celebrate Alex and me, and I'm SO excited to celebrate you and Maggie this summer!!! What an amazing time!!!

It has been so fun to get to know you over the past decade - from Lemense shenanigans to the Dubliner to as Maggie's boyfriend - you always bring a good time.

I'm so happy to celebrate such wonderful occasions together. Have a wonderful night and cheers to an amazing 2023!!
