DG!!!

The grand "Flynn-ale"! Our last wedding is here!!

Since Lindsay's wedding so many ions ago (epic) to all our other amazing celebrations of all shapes and sizes all over the country (&Italy!), it has been heartwarming to watch each of you get married. It has been equally fun to watch you all become moms (so excited for March!!). 

Whether I have seen you a lot due to proximity (Chicago, DC, NYC) or only a few times a year at our gatherings, I know I can text each of you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you all since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are each here 20 years later to celebrate!!

Annie!!!!
As I told Megan, I'm sure this will be a very interesting night to do soberly, but I'm SO HAPPY that you and Chris are here celebrating!! You have been such an amazing friend to me for the past 20 years, I am so honored to have you here and SO EXCITED to celebrate YOU and little Ehlinger coming so soon.
Thank you for being such a supportive friend - I love you!
