Dear Becca and Jeff,

WAHOOOOO!! Parents' night out!!! I hope you guys are having the time of your life and letting LOOSE!! The people at this table tonight are some of my dearest friends, I hope you are able to chat with a few of them.

Thank you SO much for celebrating with us tonight. Becs, the earliest of days Colleen would always say "Case, you will really love Becca. She's really cool you will get along so well"... to you living with my parents for a hot second before Baltimore... to you meeting Jeff... to your spectacular wedding.. AH! I love it all. 

Thank you so much for sharing all your joys and journeys with us Flynns. We love you both so much and now love GEORGE just as much!!!

With Alex in the fold, I cannot wait for all our future celebrations. Cheers to amazing family and friends.
