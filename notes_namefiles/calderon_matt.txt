Dear Alie and Matt,

We are so thrilled to have you both join us at our wedding! Your positive and wonderful spirits always bring joy to those around you, and we can't wait to celebrate with you on our special day.

I have so many fond memories of running the half marathon with you last October and am grateful to have such supportive and tenacious friends like you in our lives.  Alie, you are such a supportive and inspirational force in my, Trish's, and Courtney's lives.  Matt, it's an honor to a former student of Casey's at our wedding!  She speaks so highly of you, your work ethic, and your character.  We are so grateful to have you both by our side on our big day.

We can't wait to celebrate with you and are so grateful to have you as a part of our special day.

Love,

Alex
