Dear Aunt Joan and Uncle Tommy,

If this party is 50% as fun as Jillian and Lukas's, then I will be HAPPY! You guys know how to throw an amazing party!!! I hope you are able to sit back, relax, and enjoy this one with no obligations (except thank you SO MUCH for Rosalita, Uncle Tommy!!). 

Thank you so much for all your love and support over the years. Aunt Joan, I still remember you giving me my first highlights all those many years ago. You are one of the absolute hardest workers I know - the way you have reinvented/retrained yourself to be an expert in so many fields is absolutely inspiring! Uncle Tommy, you are the masculine glue to the overly-feminine Wessel side. Thanks for always keeping it real and keeping us laughing. 

Thank you for welcoming Alex with open arms - he has felt your love and support from our very first Easter! 

I hope you have an amazing night and cheers to a banging 2023!!!
