Dear Dr. and Mrs. Collazo,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! As our neighbors for almost 15 years, you have been such a kind and supportive presence in our lives, and we are grateful to have you as friends.  Trish, Courtney, Mom, Dad, Casey, and I absolutely adore you both and your two beautiful and wonderful children.

I have always enjoyed talking with you about your adventures as a young couple in New York, and have always been inspired by Dr. Collazo's tireless advocacy for his patients and work ethic.  Mrs. Collazo, your ability to turn any room you are in into a party is truly remarkable.  You have that rare and precious gift of making everyone feel like they are welcomed and belong.  And I have always admired your warm and welcoming personality.

We are so thankful that you live next to our parents and are a part of our lives. We can't wait to celebrate our love with you.

With love and gratitude,

Alexander
