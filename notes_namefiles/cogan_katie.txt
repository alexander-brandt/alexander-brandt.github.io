Katie,

Omgoodness I can't believe I'm getting married and you're here with your adorable husband and you have a 1.5year old(ish) son!!!! We sure have come a long way since Corocoran!!!!

I am so honored to be one of your friends. You are seriously the kindest, and most loyal friend I could imagine. Thank you for the love and patience you have shown me over the years as we travel on this crazy path of life. I cherish the walks, coffees, exercise dates, birthday celebrations, and everything in between. You are one of the best listeners I know, and I am so grateful to always have you to talk to!!

I am so happy that you and Robert and Chase (and the dogs!) have such an amazing life. I cannot wait to celebrate more milestones, along with the everyday joys.

Thanks for celebrating with me tonight,
Xoxox
Casey
