To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

SALLY!!
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!!! You and Jillian's wedding truly did inspire this all. I would have taken everything the same but Minnesota with no connection probably would have been a hard sell for me.

Thank you for being such an amazing friend. You always do such a good job of showing up for everyone, even when you have little kids in tow. I am always laughing with you -- you literally kill me. 

Thanks for bringing such positive energy, a listening ear, and endless support. I'm so happy you're here tonight!!
