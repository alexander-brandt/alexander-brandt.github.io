Aunt Sharon and Uncle Paul-

Thank you so much for celebrating with us THREE NIGHTS in a row!!!! We have loved every second of being with you and I'm so grateful for your love and support. I heard so much about you from the very beginning of dating Alex, and since meeting you at Christmas brunch last year, I could tell why. You're warmth, love of family, and just excitement for life is palpable. 

I have loved hearing about your move to Tampa and hope to visit sometime in the next few years!!! 

Thank you so much for everything - I hope you have the BEST night!!
