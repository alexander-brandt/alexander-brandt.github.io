Dear Steve and Renee,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration!  Uncle Steve, we have always admired your dedication to keeping our family beach trip a yearly tradition. Your love of golf and your ability to make all of the cousins laugh is legendary.  No bundles warmth, fun, and a good joke quite like you!

Aunt Renee, your enthusiasm and support for our wedding have meant the world to us, and we have always appreciated your warm and loving presence. Your role as a mother and aunt is truly admirable, and we are so grateful to have you in our lives.

We can't wait to celebrate our love with you and to create even more special memories together.

With love and gratitude,

Alexander
