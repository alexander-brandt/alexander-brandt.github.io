To my favorite McCarthys--

Omgosh I can't believe all 7 of the McCarthys are here to celebrate!!! It has been such fun to watch you all grow up -- from Michael's freshmen year to his 5th year at Fairfield... it's been a wild ride!! It is an honor to have you all with me tonight.

Sunday nights at your home were always hilarious -- sometimes routine... planning classes, keeping up with homework, finishing projects -- sometimes absolutely batshit crazy... someone had an exam they hadn't started studying for, a project that was late, the usual.... It was endlessly entertaining and sometimes weirdly stressful. 

Patrick,
Your last year at Fairfield!! I'm so so excited for you. You are such a kind, capable, talented soul. I cannot wait to see what you do when you graduate next year. I hope to see you in NYC for a few years, at least!!
Have so much fun tonight - you and Gen behave yourselves!!
