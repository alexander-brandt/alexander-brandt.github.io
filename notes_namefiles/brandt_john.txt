Dear Grandpa and Mimi,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! Your support and love have meant the world to us, and we are grateful to be marrying into such a wonderful and loving Catholic family like the one you have cultivated.

Grandpa, your devotion to scholarship and your legal career have always been an inspiration to us, and we admire your hard work and dedication. Mimi, your generosity with your time and your efforts to bring the family together through your hosting of family events have been so appreciated.

We are so thankful for the many kind presents you have given us during our engagement, and we are grateful for everything you have done for us.

We can't wait to celebrate our love with you and to begin our new lives together as a married couple.

With love and gratitude,
Alexander and Casey
