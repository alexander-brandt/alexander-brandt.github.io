Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Dear John (oh you go by Jack? Weird).

I love your hair!!! I saw you last week and it looked fire. You and Matt are def the only two cousins who can rock this look.
You have become such a cool adult!! PreCalc was fun and all, but hearing about your cool hiking adventures is way more fun. I hope you always keep doing fun things like that and reporting back, I'm taking notes on the different national parks I want to go to as well.
Hopefully you and Alex can set up a D&D game in the future.

Until then, thanks for celebrating with us and have an amazing night!!
