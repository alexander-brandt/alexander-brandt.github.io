Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Nick, 

Thank you so much for being here tonight!! You and Michelle share so much joy - I love watching your cooking and housing adventures on instagram and when we are together over holidays, I love watching the obvious happiness that you bring to one another. 

I can't wait to see you on the dance floor - especially during Rosalita!!
