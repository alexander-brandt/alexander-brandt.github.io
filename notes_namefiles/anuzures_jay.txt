Dear Kristen and Jay,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration!  Your attendence is particularly special, because YOUR wedding was one of the first I ever attended, and we still remember all the music, dancing, and fun that we shared together.  Your warm and loving personalities have always brightened any room lucky enough to have you.

Your love of playing music and your dedication to creating joy and merriment have always inspired us, and we are so grateful to have you as friends and cousins.  We can't wait to celebrate our love with you and to create even more special memories together.

Love,

Alexander
