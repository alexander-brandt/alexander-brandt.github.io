JEFFREYYYYYYY!!!!

My man!! Alex's ride or die!! The number one person on earth that keeps google hangouts alive!! How are you?!? Are you having so much fun yet?? I hope so!!

Thank you so much for everything you have done for Alex and me this past year. I heard about you from probably date 2 or 3, and since then Alex has not stopped regaling me with stories about how you and he used to take Berkley by storm. He loves you like a brother, and I'm so happy for him that he has such a beautiful friendship with you.

I appreciate your love and support of our relationship, and I look forward to many trips, visits, celebrations, and conquering life's milestones together in the future.

See you on the dance floor!!
