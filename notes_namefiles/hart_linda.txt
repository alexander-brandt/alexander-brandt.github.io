Dear Lala,

Welcome to our wedding celebration! We are so happy to have you here with us on this special day.

Your love of cooking and your adventurous spirit have always been an inspiration to me, my sisters, my Mom, and my Dad. Your delicious meals and enthusiasm for family have brighted up so many Boyce/Brandt/Hart gatherings. We are grateful to have such a wonderful aunt like you, who always knows how to make every moment memorable.

We hope you have a wonderful time at the wedding and enjoy all the festivities. Thank you for being such a special part of our lives and for making this day even more special with your presence.

With love,

Alexander
