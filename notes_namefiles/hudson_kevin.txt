Kevin and Laura,

Thank you SO MUCH for being with me to celebrate tonight. I am so happy that you (finally!) got to meet Alex and that you were able to take the time to get babysitters for your precious children. I know that a lot more logistics are needed than 5-7 years ago, and I appreciate the effort!!

While I miss seeing you guys as much as I used to, I love that when I do see you both, it is as if no time has passed. Hopefully I'll get a few more visits with you now that I live on the Jersey side (hey Hoboken!) and post-covid I'll have more time for non-family visits when I'm in DC.

Until then, I know I can count on both of you to get this party started to celebrate all things Catholic Marriage.

See you on the dance floor!!!!
