Dear Laura,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! Your warm and witty personality has been such a joy to be around, and it has been a pleasure to see us all grow up together.

Your wedding in Annapolis was such a beautiful and memorable occasion, and we were honored to be a part of it. You looked absolutely wonderful on your big day, and we are so happy for you and Steve.

Congratulations on your recent move to Colorado! We hope that you will enjoy your new home and all the adventures that it brings.

We are so thankful for your presence at our wedding, and we can't wait to celebrate our love with you.

With love and gratitude,

Alexander and Casey
