Dear Jen,

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all of your love and support during my wedding. Your kindness and generosity have meant so much to me, and I am so grateful to have you as my cousin.  I will always treasure the memories of the time we spent together in Berkeley and San Francisco. Your warmth and hospitality made me feel at home in a new city, and I will always be grateful for the dinners, parties, and hang outs in the city parks that we shared. You have always been such a kind and caring friend, and I am so lucky to have you in my life.

As a wonderful mother, wife and daughter, you have always inspired me with your dedication to your family. Your and Zach's partnership has been an inspiration to watch grow.  I am lucky to learn from your example.

Thank you again for everything, Jen. I am so blessed to have you as my cousin and friend, and I hope you will visit us in New Jersey... or we can pay you and the other members of team Hart a visit in VA soon!

With love and appreciation,

Alex
