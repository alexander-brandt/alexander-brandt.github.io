Dear Mr. Huff,

It's very difficult to put into words the apprecation I have for you, Mrs. Huff, and your wonderful children.  You all have always been a paragon of steadfastness and virtue.  There are very few people I have known from such a young age, but your beautiful and incredible family has been a source of many important and amazing memories as I grew up.

As I grew up and we spent many nights staring up at the stars with you, Connor, my Dad, and myself, I was privledged to get to know you more.  You are a singular and spectacular individual.  Your laugh is infectious.  Your character is undeniable.

Thank you for joining Casey and me today.  I hope to one day build a family that emulates your grit, tenacity, warmth, and love.

All my love,

Alexander
