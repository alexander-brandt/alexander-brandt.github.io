Liddi girls,

Who in the right mind let me babysit you at age 12 for like 8 hours a day? No wonder we're all so weird!! Just kidding (kinda). 

Monica, 

Thank you SO much for being here tonight to celebrate Alex and me!!! You and Ross are so so fun to have around, I love both of your alls self-deprecating humor and dry wit. You always do such an amazing job at showing up for others, and I really really appreciate it.

Thanks for being such an amazing cousin, and I hope you have a fantastic time tonight!!!
