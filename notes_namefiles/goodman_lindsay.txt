Dear Lindsey,

We are so excited to have you join us at our wedding celebration! Your charming and witty personality has made such a positive impact on our lives, and we are grateful to have you as a friend.

Your kindness towards me and my sisters as we have gotten to know the Flynn family has meant so much to us. It was such a pleasure to visit with all of you at your Christmas party, and we appreciate how welcoming you and Daniel have been.

Congratulations on the arrival of your precious new baby, Chase. Your texts and perspective during the early stages of our relationship and engagement were so valuable to Casey, and we are grateful for your support.

Thank you for being such a wonderful and supportive friend. We can't wait to celebrate our love with you.

Sincerely,

Alexander
