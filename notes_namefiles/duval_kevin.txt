Cousins-in-law, 

You have survived our quirky, quirky family... which gives me so much hope for Alex!!! Thank you for fully embracing the holiday antics, the togetherness, and the love. Each of the cousins has picked such a gem, and I love having you a part of our clan. 

Kevin,
Thank you SO MUCH for making the trip up from North Carolina -- I really appreciate it!! I know it is not easy during the holidays and with the girls, but I love having (almost) the whole family with me tonight. 

You and Kellie are always such fun to have when you are around. I love watching the Duval girls grow up - you have done such an amazing job building your family unit!!

Cheers to 2023 and all the new fun memories and adventures to come!
