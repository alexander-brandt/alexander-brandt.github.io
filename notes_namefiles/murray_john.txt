Mr. and Mrs. Murray,

Thank you SO MUCH for being here with Alex and me to celebrate such a momentous occasion. Some of my absolute favorite memories growing up were at the Murray household -- whether it when I was down the street at the Liddi's babysitting or coming over to hang for a tailgate and the Redskins games, your welcoming "come one come all" attitude always made me feel so welcome.

I am so happy that you could be here for this milestone and I can't wait to watch Kevin and Lily tie the knot so soon!!!!

Thank you so much for your love and friendship
