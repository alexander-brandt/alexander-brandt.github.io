Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and I tonight.

Mr. App,

Thank you so much for being here to celebrate Alex and I. The Flynn-App family vacations will forever go down as some of my favorite childhood memories. It is an honor that so many Apps could be here tonight!! Thank you for all your love and support.
