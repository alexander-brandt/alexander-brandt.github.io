Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Pats,
During SJB and Visitation, you might as well have been like 20 years younger than me, thats how big the gap felt. As we've gotten older, I have absolutely loved catching up with you and hanging out. You actually were the first family member to even hear about Alex!! 
I'm so sad that you live in Wisconsin but I know that you'll be back to visit all the time. I cannot WAIT to celebrate you and Tom in just a short 7 months -- enjoy this time -- it seriously flies by!!!
Cheers to 2023 and all the fun it will bring!!
