To my Alpha Phis,

We sure have come a long way since the 479 Comm Ave Neighborhood, where life across the river was so good. 

Thank you so much for being here with Alex and me tonight; it means the world that you have traveled this way to ring in the New Year with us!! You have truly seen my good, bad, ugly, and amazing, and everything in between. This is such a huge milestone for me, and it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't surrounded by you all. 

WENDY!!!

You are a ROCKSTAR!! Thank you for leaving your precious Aidan, traveling cross country, and making time to celebrate me and Alex!! I am so impressed with you -- no matter how busy you are, how successful you are, you always make time for friends. Thank you for being such an AMAZING example of "how to do it all."

I can't wait to party, dance, and cheers you and Robbie all night long.

Cheers to an amazing 2023!!
