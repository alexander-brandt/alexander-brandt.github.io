Dear Flynn/Polanini cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

MaryKate!!!

I'm so excited to be your neighbor!!! You've always been a great cousin friend, but it's been especially fun to get to know you better as adults these past four years. I've loved our workout classes, dinners, drinks, and of course our covid adventure to Palm Springs!! It was such a great light in a time of darkness, and I was so happy that you could join me!!!
I hope Chris has a great time at his first Flynn wedding... he should with a hot babe rocking a sparkly pink dress on his arms!!!
