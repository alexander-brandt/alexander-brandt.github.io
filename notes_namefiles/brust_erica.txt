Erica!!!

Thank you SO MUCH for coming tonight to celebrate with Alex and me!!! It means so much to me to have you and Joe here on this momentous occasion.

Your friendship has meant so much to me over the years -- from our lax and aphi days to our cross country visits; whether they were on Nantucket, the Hamptons, North Carolina, NYC, Miami, and beyond... it's always so fun to hear about your adventurous and catch up like no time has passed.

I adore watching yours and Joe's family grow --  you are the best mom and wife!! Thank you for being an amazing friend.

I love you!
