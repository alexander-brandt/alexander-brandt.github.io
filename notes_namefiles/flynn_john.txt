Dear Mr. and Mrs. Flynn,

Welcome to our wedding celebration!

We are so grateful to have you join us on this special day. You have been so welcoming to me as I have joined the family, and we have had such a great time together, especially at your beach house in Ocean City, NJ! The cheesesteaks were some of the best I have ever had.

As my family has gotten to know you better, they were so excited to see how much the Flynns and the Brandts had in common.  My Mom cannot stop talking about how much fun she had playing pickleball and seeing Mr. Flynn's competitive and dynamic spirit in action.  Mrs. Flynn, your love for your family is truly admirable and we are so grateful for all that you do.  And thank you both for joining us at the rehearsal, it was such a fun and funny evening. We are so happy to have you both with us on this special day.

Sincerely,

Alex
