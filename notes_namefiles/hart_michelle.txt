Michelle,

Thank you so much for coming out from San Diego to celebrate with me and Casey!  I have always admired the spirit of excitement, fun, and joy you bring to all our family events.  It doesn't matter if you are a part of surfing lessons, taco/guacamole recipes, or golf trips, you always bring your best and most vibrant self.  I am so thankful for your positive influence in my life and our shared interests (mostly sports related... but also my questions inspired from law-enforcement podcasts!).  Thank you for your luminous self.  Casey and I love and cherish you so much.

Sincerely,

Alexander
