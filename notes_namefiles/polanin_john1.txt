Dear Flynn cousins,

Do you ever feel bad for other people? That they don't have an amazing family like ours?? I'm not even a little kidding, but please don't share this widely. But I look at other people's ChristmasEve dinners with like 5 people and I'm just like oh? That must be.... So quiet.... And normal.... Do you not have cousin of the year? 12 days of Christmas? Happy Birthday to Jesus? No... no??? Hmm weird 

Anyways, thanks for being the best and weirdest family out there. 

Johnny,
Our fearless male cousin leader!! It has been so fun to watch you build an awesome life for yourself in Philly. You and Lindsey seem to have such a great thing going -- she is such an amazing addition to our quirky family! You each compliment each other so well, you truly bring out the best in one another. You seem so yourself and at ease with her, and it something I aspire to for my own relationship.
Thanks for being an amazing example to the rest of us!
I hope you have an amazing night!!
