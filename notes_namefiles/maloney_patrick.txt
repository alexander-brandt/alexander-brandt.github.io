Patrick-

You literally CRACK ME UP every time I see you. My favorite moments were when I entered the Dubliner and I was just hear your booming voice!! No one ever quite understood when I said you were my cousin - kind of - but I never really cared enough to fully explain.

I'm so happy you're here with us to celebrate tonight. You always do a great job of showing up - what an amazing quality, especially with family. Thanks for being such a fun and supportive pseudo-cousin.

I love you!!
