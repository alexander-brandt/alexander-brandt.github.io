Dear Brittany,

Welcome to our wedding! We are so happy that you could make it and be a part of our special day.

I couldn't be more thankful that you married Mike and joined our family.  Your love and care for him is evident in the joy and happiness you bring into his life. As a mother to Holden, you have shown us the true meaning of love and we are grateful to have you as a role model. Your beautifully decorated home is always a pleasure to visit and we are honored to be able to share in this special occasion with you.  So excited for all the memories we will make in 2023!

Sincerely,

Alexander
