Dear Uncle John and Aunt Sara,

Thank you so much for traveling down for the wedding celebrations, and an extra special thank you for ensuring that Grandma Bon arrives as well!!!

It has so fun to see you through so many different stages of life, but this most recent one you guys seem to be enjoying yourself SO much! I'm so happy that life at the beach seems to suit you -- I'm still waiting for my turn to visit and get on the jet skis!!

I appreciate all the holidays and events that you still come back for. I'm so lucky to have such a wonderful family, and thank you so much for being such an amazing part of it!!!

I hope you have a wonderful night!!
