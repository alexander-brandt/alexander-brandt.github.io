Dear Colleen,

Thank you so much for being such an incredible sister and matron of honor to Casey.  Getting to know you, Mike, and the rest of your beatuiful family has been such an amazing priveledge.  When we began spending time together, Casey and I had many conversations about our siblings.  In particular, she mentioned how much she loves and admires her two big sisters.  You and Janice have set such an amazing example for Timmy and Casey... and now I get to learn from you both as well!

I am so thankful for your warm and welcoming nature.  I feel like whenever I get to spend time with the Williams you ask the most interesting/thought provoking questions.  And it has been so wild to see how much Charlie, Reese, Peter, and now Tommy have grown up in the year and a half that I first met them.  Your children are so wonderful and share your thoughtful and friendly nature.  Casey and I love you all so much and are so excited to grow together a new unit of Team Flynn.

Sincerely,

Alexander Brandt
