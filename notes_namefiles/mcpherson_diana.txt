Liddi girls,

Who in the right mind let me babysit you at age 12 for like 8 hours a day? No wonder we're all so weird!! Just kidding (kinda). 

Diana, 

Thank you SO much for being here tonight to celebrate Alex and me!!! YOURE SO WELCOME that it is an in-town wedding!!!!!!! :)

You're seriously KILLING it, girlfriend. I am so in awe of all that you do. Your patience, gentleness, fortitude, persistence, and just overall bad-assert amazes me. I have so adored watching you grow your fam with Matt. 

I love you SO much and keep being your amazing self. Thank you for your positivity, joy, and support!!!
