Aunt Eileen and Uncle Mike,

Thank you for being the best supporters around. From our Peachstone and Donna Drive days, you have always been such amazing cheerleaders. I cherish all our amazing memories at the beach, in the neighborhood, up to Boston, visiting New Jersey, I could go on.

Thank you both for doing an amazing job keeping our traditions going. The Turkeybowl and Christmas Eve are two of my favorite days/events. I know that SO much work goes into both, and I'm so so appreciative. I know that year after year it can seem as if it is just expected, but I am appreciative each and every year!

I love you both SO much and am so grateful that you have been so kind in welcoming Alex into our family. Have an AMAZING night and cheers to a great start to 2023!!!
