To my APhi husbands,

You all are GEMS!!! Thank you so much for putting up with us crazy fools!! I love each of these girls so much, and your wife loves you so much, so therefore I love YOU so much!!

Joe-

Thank you for celebrating with Alex and me tonight. It means so much that you are here, as I know it's not easy to travel over the holidays and leave two kids behind!! I have absolutely adored watching you and Erica make such a beautiful family together.

I hope to see you more over the next decade but until then, have an AMAZING night tonight and cheers to 2023!!!
