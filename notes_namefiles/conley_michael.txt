Mr. and Mrs. Conley,

Your love, friendship, FUN, and generosity know no bounds. Thank you so much for showering Alex and me with such amazing gifts and love this past year!!

I am so so excited that you are with us tonight. My parents always love planning their next adventure with you -- you guys know how to plan a road trip! Your time in Florida, the golf trips, and just general shenanigans give me something to aspire to. 

Thank you for embracing the entire Flynn clan this past decade - we are so lucky to have your friendship, support, words of encouragement, and prayers.

Cheers to an amazing new chapter for Alex and me, and cheers to good friends like you!!

Casey
