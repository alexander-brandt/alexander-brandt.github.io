MAGGIE!!!!

Omgod you're almost next!!!!! I can't believe I just got married and you're SO SOON!!! I love you!!!

It has been so fun to have you as a friend all these years. Whether it was being on opposing sides for Gold/White, dancing at Sweet 16s, to reconnecting many years later over bowling teams and roommates, I have the utmost admiration for you. You are insanely disciplined and supremely loyal. 

I am so lucky to have you as a cheerleader in my court, and I am so excited for you and Brian and your next chapter. Thanks for always making time for lunch with me and a good catch up. They are good for the soul!

Have SO much fun tonight!!!
