Table 16:

When I think of where I want to be in 30-ish years, I'm not 100% sure where that is. But I know two things: I want to be married to Alex, and I want to have a friend group like yours.

What an amazing place St. John the Baptist was to bring this phenomenal group of people together. Your love and support of one another through births, baptisms, marriages, sicknesses, deaths - you all are a true example of celebrating and doubling each other's happinesses and halving the pain. Thank you for being such amazing friends to my parents and supporting me from near and afar. It is truly a privilege to have you hear with Alex and me tonight.

Nan,
You are the best listener around. Your thoughtfulness, loyalty, positivity, and support are unmatched. It is truly a joy to see you each and every time I'm around. Thank you for bringing all the Flynns such energy and enthusiasm.

I love you and all the Iuculanos so much. Thanks for supporting and loving Alex and me.
