Camila!!!!!

From your family trip to Cancun... to bball days... to One Tree Hill... to your wedding (epic) to tonight.... I am so happy to have you as my friend!!!

Whether I see you a ton or only once a year, I know I can text you out of the blue for a random recommendation, question, or simply to say hi. I have loved you since 2002, and I'm so happy that you are here 20 years later to celebrate!!

Watching you and Alex grow the most adorable family is something that warms my heart. I know you could be a million places tonight but thank you for choosing to be here and for bringing so much enthusiasm - I have felt it all year long!!

See you on the dance floor!!!
