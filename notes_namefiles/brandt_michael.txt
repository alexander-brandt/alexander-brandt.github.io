Dear Mike,

Welcome to our wedding celebration!  It has been such a joy to have you as an uncle since I was little, and a close friend as I grew older. The shared love of books, cooking, and craft beer has brought us so many fun memories over the years. I have always looked up to you as a role model for following your passions while also keeping a strong focus on friends and family. Your enthusiasm and fun-loving spirit added so much to my bachelor party and I am so glad to have you by my side on this special day with Casey. Thank you for being a part of our journey and for sharing in this celebration with us, and your wisdom and friendship that helped lead me to this moment.

Love,

Alexander
