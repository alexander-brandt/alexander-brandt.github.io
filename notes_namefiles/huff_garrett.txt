G-MAN.

There is almost never a time I see a NERF football or similar without thinking of us tossing bombs in Africa or Italy.  I'm sure that I am an old man at this point... but I remember seeing you in the Big Apple Circus and swiming with Courtney/Trish in costal climates.  You are a sharp and brilliant young man and I am so thankful you and your family could join Casey and me on this day.  You're the best, bud.  Can't wait to celebrate you in all the years to come.

Best,

Alex
