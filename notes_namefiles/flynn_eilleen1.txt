Dear Eileen,

Thank you so much for coming in on a holiday weekend to celebrate!!! I am so so excited to have you here with us. 

I absolutely love catching up with you each year in OCNJ. I love hearing about your year and especially your travels. You have the best stories and seem to have gone to all the best places!!

Thank you for being such a kind and welcoming presence - you put Alex at ease when he was a bit overwhelmed by the whole crew!! You are the best.

I hope you have a wonderful night - cheers to an amazing 2023!!
