Dear [Not-So-Little-Anymore!] Donald,

We are so excited to have you with us at our wedding celebration!  "WILL DONALD BE THERE?!" was something my Mom heard constantly as we got ready for holiday celebrations or trips to DE/NC beaches.  I was always so excited to see my cool older cousin who always had awesome music and made me feel special to be included playing cards or tossing glowsticks into the night sky.  Your love of fitness and soccer have always inspired me, and I have so many fond memories of playing together on our family trips.

As we grew up I was so thankful that our friendship deepened and matured.  I will never forget the time we snuck our first beers together and laughed the entire night long. Or walking the streets of San Francisco with Jen and looking at the sunsets over Alta Plaza Park.  Those moments have always stayed with me, and I am grateful to have you as such a special part of my life.

Thank you for being such an important and beloved member of our family. We can't wait to see you and celebrate our love with you.

With love and gratitude,

Alexander
